# An Algebraic Type System for Reinforcement Schedules

## Abstract

This document formalizes the taxonomy of reinforcement schedules as an algebraic type system, providing a theoretical foundation for the contingency-dsl domain-specific language. We show that every simple reinforcement schedule is a product of two independent dimensions — Distribution and Domain — yielding a 3×3 grid of atomic schedules. We define a composition algebra over seven combinators (Concurrent, Alternative, Conjunctive, Chained, Tandem, Multiple, Mixed) with formally characterized algebraic properties including commutativity, associativity, identity elements, and annihilators. A denotational semantics (§2.13) maps each schedule expression to a Mealy-machine–style schedule machine, enabling compositional reasoning about semantic equivalence with a formal adequacy theorem linking the denotational and operational definitions.

## Part I: Atomic Schedule Taxonomy — The Product Type Distribution × Domain

### 1.1 Two Independent Dimensions

Every simple reinforcement schedule can be expressed as the product of two independent dimensions. This insight, implicit in Ferster and Skinner's (1957) original taxonomy and made explicit in the OperantKit framework's bit-packed `ScheduleType` (Mizutani, 2018), admits the following formalization.

**Definition 1 (Distribution).** The value distribution dimension determines *how* the schedule parameter is selected across successive reinforcement cycles.

```
Distribution ::= Fixed | Variable | Random
```

- **Fixed**: The parameter value is constant across all reinforcement cycles. Deterministic.
- **Variable**: The parameter is drawn from a Fleshler-Hoffman (1962) generated sequence that guarantees mean-preserving, non-replacement sampling within each cycle. Quasi-random with controlled statistical properties.
- **Random**: The parameter is sampled independently on each trial from a uniform distribution. Truly stochastic, memoryless.

The critical distinction between Variable and Random — often confused in the literature — is that Variable uses a pre-computed Fleshler-Hoffman sequence cycled deterministically, while Random generates a fresh value per trial. This corresponds to sampling without replacement from a constrained distribution (Variable) versus sampling with replacement from a simple distribution (Random). The Variable distribution implements the constant-probability-of-reinforcement-per-response assumption more faithfully than naive randomization (Fleshler & Hoffman, 1962).

**Definition 2 (Domain).** The contingency domain dimension determines *what behavioral dimension* the schedule parameter applies to.

```
Domain ::= Ratio | Interval | Time
```

- **Ratio**: The parameter specifies a response count. Reinforcement is contingent upon emitting N responses. Response-dependent.
- **Interval**: The parameter specifies a time duration. Reinforcement is contingent upon the first response *after* the interval has elapsed. Both response-dependent and time-dependent (conjunctive).
- **Time**: The parameter specifies a time duration. Reinforcement is delivered when time elapses regardless of behavior. Response-independent (non-contingent).

The behavioral significance: Ratio schedules generate high, steady response rates with characteristic post-reinforcement pauses (Ferster & Skinner, 1957, Ch. 3-4). Interval schedules produce scalloped or break-and-run patterns insensitive to rate above a minimal threshold (Ferster & Skinner, 1957, Ch. 5-6). Time schedules maintain behavior through adventitious reinforcement (Skinner, 1948) or, under proper parameterization, approximate operant schedules (Schoenfeld & Cole, 1972). FT produces positively accelerated responding (scalloping) despite response-independence (Zeiler, 1968; Herrnstein & Morse, 1957); VT produces steady or erratic rates distinct from FT (Zeiler, 1968). Response-reinforcer independence (FT/VT) produces slower response decrement than conventional extinction (Lattal, 1972).

**Definition 3 (Atomic Schedule).** An atomic schedule is the product type:

```
AtomicSchedule = Distribution × Domain × Value
```

where `Value ∈ ℝ⁺` (response count for Ratio; seconds for Interval/Time).

This yields the **3 × 3 grid**:

|              | Ratio    | Interval | Time     |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Fixed**    | FR(*n*)  | FI(*t*)  | FT(*t*)  |
| **Variable** | VR(*n*)  | VI(*t*)  | VT(*t*)  |
| **Random**   | RR(*n*)  | RI(*t*)  | RT(*t*)  |

### 1.2 The Bit-Packed Encoding

The OperantKit framework (Mizutani, 2018) encodes this product type as a `UInt64` with `PrepositionSchedule` (Distribution) in the upper 16 bits and `PostpositionSchedule` (Domain) in the lower 16 bits. Query methods extract each dimension independently via bit-shifting:

```
hasFixedSchedule()    →  (rawValue << 32) >> 48 == Fixed
hasRatioSchedule()    →  (rawValue << 48) >> 48 == Ratio
```

This encoding is a *tagged product* that preserves the 2D queryability at the type level. The Python equivalent does not require bit-packing but must preserve this dimensional independence — an enum pair or frozen dataclass with `.distribution` and `.domain` properties serves the same purpose with better ergonomics.

### 1.3 Degenerate and Boundary Cases

**EXT (Extinction)** has `rawValue = 0` in the OperantKit encoding. It is the *zero element* of the schedule algebra: `EXT.is_satisfied()` always returns `false`. Formally:

```
EXT = AtomicSchedule(distribution = ⊥, domain = ⊥, value = 0)
```

The zero encoding is not accidental but reflects that extinction is the absence of reinforcement contingency — the additive identity of the schedule space.

**CRF (Continuous Reinforcement)** is `FR(1)` — the *identity element* for ratio schedules. The OperantKit source explicitly notes: "FR 1 と結果は同一" (results are identical to FR 1). Formally:

```
CRF ≡ FR(1) = AtomicSchedule(Fixed, Ratio, 1)
```

CRF is not a separate type but a named constant. Every response produces reinforcement; it is the lower bound of the ratio dimension.

### 1.4 Non-Grid Schedules

Certain schedules do not fit the 3 × 3 grid because they operate on different behavioral dimensions.

**Differential Reinforcement (DR) Schedules** are *constraint schedules* that gate reinforcement based on temporal properties of the response stream — specifically, inter-response time (IRT) — rather than response count or elapsed time.

```
DRConstraint ::= DRL(irt_min : ℝ⁺)       -- IRT ≥ threshold
               | DRH(irt_max : ℝ⁺)       -- IRT ≤ threshold
               | DRO(omission_time : ℝ⁺)  -- no response for duration
```

**Note on the name "DRO."** The abbreviation stands for "Differential Reinforcement of Other behavior," but this name is historically misleading. Component analyses demonstrate that DRO's effectiveness depends primarily on its *omission/extinction* contingency, not on reinforcing "other" behavior (Mazaleski et al., 1993; Rey et al., 2020; Hronek & Kestner, 2025). The current DSL represents fixed whole-interval DRO; Lindberg et al. (1999) 2×2 taxonomy is deferred to v1.x. See [design-rationale.md §1](../../../docs/en/design-rationale.md#1-dro-why-other-behavior-is-a-misnomer) for the full evidence review.

DR schedules sit orthogonally to the grid and are best understood as **filters** or **modifiers** that can be composed with grid schedules via tandem or conjunctive composition. For example, `Tand(VR 20, DRL 5-s)` requires a variable-ratio response count *and* an inter-response time ≥ 5 seconds.

**Standalone DR modifiers.** A DR modifier written without an enclosing combinator (e.g., `DRL 5-s` as a top-level schedule expression) is semantically equivalent to that modifier applied to an implicit CRF base schedule — i.e., `DRL 5-s` ≡ `Tand(CRF, DRL 5-s)`. This matches standard laboratory notation: "DRL 20-s" in the literature denotes a schedule in which every response satisfying the IRT criterion is reinforced (Ferster & Skinner, 1957, Ch. 8; Kramer & Rilling, 1970). The implicit CRF is a semantic default documented in [defaults.md](../../../schema/core/defaults.md); conforming parsers emit a `Modifier` AST node without desugaring.

**Note on DRA/DRI.** Differential Reinforcement of Alternative behavior (DRA) and Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible behavior (DRI) are clinical procedure labels commonly used in applied behavior analysis (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2020). Unlike DRO/DRL/DRH, which are single-operandum schedule modifiers defined by temporal parameters, DRA/DRI inherently specify contingencies across *two* response classes (extinction for the target behavior, reinforcement for the alternative). At the schedule level, DRA is expressible as a concurrent arrangement:

```
let dra = Conc(EXT, CRF)           -- or Conc(EXT, FR 1), Conc(EXT, VI 30-s), etc.
```

DRI is a special case of DRA where the alternative behavior is physically incompatible with the target; the schedule structure is identical. The distinction is topographical (which behavior is selected as the alternative), not procedural. Therefore, DRA/DRI are not DSL primitives but documented patterns using existing combinators. Clinical metadata (behavioral function, alternative behavior description) is delegated to the annotation layer (see [architecture.md §4.7](architecture.md)).

**Progressive Ratio (PR)** is a *meta-schedule*: a ratio schedule whose parameter itself changes according to a deterministic step function indexed by the number of reinforcements delivered.

```
PR(step : ℕ → ℕ) = FR(step(n)) where n increments after each reinforcement
```

PR is a *schedule functor* — it maps a step function to a sequence of FR schedules. The DSL offers two syntactic forms:

- **Shorthand:** `PR n` — arithmetic progression with step size *n* (Jarmolowicz & Lattal, 2010). `PR 5` expands to `PR(linear, start=5, increment=5)`, producing FR 5, FR 10, FR 15, ... This matches the notation proposed in *The Behavior Analyst* and is the natural form for educational and clinical contexts.
- **Explicit:** `PR(hodos)`, `PR(linear, start=1, increment=5)`, `PR(exponential)`, `PR(geometric, start=1, ratio=2)` — for full control over the step function. Bare `PR` without a number or parenthesized options is a parse error.

Arithmetic and geometric progressions produce qualitatively different response-rate functions, and no consensus default step function exists (Killeen et al., 2009; Stafford & Branch, 1998). See [design-rationale.md §2](../../../docs/en/design-rationale.md#2-progressive-ratio-why-the-step-function-is-required) for the evidence review, including why breakpoint ≠ Pmax (Lambert et al., 2026).

### 1.6 Limited Hold — Temporal Availability Constraint

**Definition.** A Limited Hold (LH) is a temporal constraint on reinforcement *availability* that qualifies a schedule `S`. Once `S`'s criterion is first satisfied, a hold window of duration `d` seconds opens. If a response occurs within that window, reinforcement is delivered. If no response occurs before the window closes, the reinforcement opportunity is cancelled and `S` resets.

```
S LH d
```

**State machine:**

```
WAITING
  │  S.is_satisfied(obs) → True  (records t_satisfied = obs.current_time)
  ▼
HOLD_OPEN
  │  response within d of t_satisfied  →  reinforce, S.next()  →  WAITING
  │  obs.current_time − t_satisfied > d, no response  →  cancel, S.next()  →  WAITING
```

**Algebraic properties:**
- `S LH ∞ ≡ S` — infinite hold is the identity (no constraint). See §2.2.4.
- `S LH 0 ≡ EXT` — zero hold makes reinforcement unavailable. See §2.2.4.
- LH is **not reducible to Conj**: `Conj(S, TimeWindow(d))` checks simultaneous satisfaction against the same observation (stateless). LH is state-dependent — it gates access based on a satisfaction event timestamp recorded across ticks.
- LH is **not a special case of T-tau**: T-tau duty cycles are fixed, clock-driven, and response-independent in their cycling. LH's window is triggered by `S`'s satisfaction event, not by a recurring timer. See [representations.md](representations.md) for the formal relationship.
- Algebraically, LH is a **congruent schedule qualifier**: `(− LH d) : Schedule → Schedule` for each `d ∈ ℝ⁺`.

**Formal verification of LH's algebraic status.** The LH qualifier defines a mapping from schedules to schedules: `S ↦ S LH d`. Its algebraic properties with respect to the semantic equivalence relation (§2.2.1) are:

*Property 1 (Congruence — HOLDS).* LH preserves semantic equivalence:

```
S₁ ≡ S₂  ⟹  S₁ LH d ≡ S₂ LH d
```

*Proof.* If S₁ ≡ S₂, they produce identical reinforcement outcomes for all observation traces (Definition 4, §2.2.1). For a schedule without an outer LH qualifier, the satisfaction event coincides with the reinforcement event. Therefore S₁ and S₂ satisfy at the same trace positions for any trace. Since LH's state machine transitions are determined entirely by the schedule's satisfaction events and the response stream, `S₁ LH d` and `S₂ LH d` undergo identical state transitions for any trace, producing identical outcomes. ∎

*Property 2 (Non-commutativity of nesting — composition law FAILS).* In general:

```
(S LH d₁) LH d₂ ≢ (S LH d₂) LH d₁
```

*Counterexample.* Consider `(FI 30-s LH 5) LH 10` vs. `(FI 30-s LH 10) LH 5`.

In `(FI 30-s LH 5) LH 10`: FI 30 is satisfied at t₀. A first response must occur within 5 s of t₀ (inner LH). A second response must then occur within 10 s of the first response (outer LH). In `(FI 30-s LH 10) LH 5`: FI 30 is satisfied at t₀. A first response must occur within 10 s of t₀ (inner LH). A second response must then occur within 5 s of the first response (outer LH). These impose different temporal constraints, so a trace exists that reinforces under one but not the other. ∎

*Consequence.* The original characterization of LH as an "endofunctor on the schedule algebra" is imprecise. The LH qualifier satisfies the congruence property (which corresponds to the identity-preservation functor law in the preorder category induced by ≡), but does NOT satisfy the composition-preservation functor law in any natural category structure on schedules. The correct characterization is: **LH is a congruent schedule qualifier** — it maps schedules to schedules and preserves semantic equivalence, but nested LH application is order-dependent.

**Semantics of nested LH.** `(S LH d₁) LH d₂` is interpreted as follows:
1. The schedule `S` runs until its criterion is satisfied (at time `t₀`).
2. The inner LH opens a window of `d₁` seconds. A response must occur at some `t₁ ∈ [t₀, t₀ + d₁)` for the inner LH to be satisfied.
3. The outer LH then opens a window of `d₂` seconds from `t₁`. A second response must occur at some `t₂ ∈ [t₁, t₁ + d₂)` for reinforcement to be delivered.

This effectively requires **two sequential responses** within specified time windows — a tandem-like temporal constraint. The response that satisfies the inner LH is consumed as that layer's satisfaction event; it does not also satisfy the outer LH.

**Canonical scope:**
- Interval schedules (FI, VI): primary usage — Ferster & Skinner (1957, Ch. 5).
- Time schedules (FT, VT): converts response-independent delivery into a response-dependent window.
- DRL + LH: documented in Kramer & Rilling (1970) — response must occur after IRT ≥ t and before t + d.
- DRO + LH: used clinically — the hold window opens after the omission interval elapses.
- Ratio schedules (FR, VR, RR): semantically vacuous — the satisfying response *is* the response within the window; ratio schedules are satisfied on the response itself. The v1.0 parser emits a warning for `FR n LH d`.

**Design note: qualifier, not modifier.** LH is classified as a **temporal availability qualifier** — an optional parameter *of* the schedule — not a modifier that wraps the schedule from outside. In the behavioral literature, LH is always written as an attribute of a schedule ("FI 30-s LH 10-s", "VI 1-min with limited hold"), never as a function applied to a schedule. The schedule is the grammatical and conceptual subject; LH constrains an aspect of it.

This distinction has concrete consequences:

| Aspect | Qualifier (adopted) |
|---|---|
| Notation | `FI 30 LH 10` — schedule is the subject |
| Python API | `FI(30, limitedHold=10)` or `FI(30, LH=10)` |
| Grammar | `<schedule> ::= <base_schedule> ("LH" <value>)?` — postfix clause |
| AST | `limitedHold` is an optional property on leaf nodes, not a wrapper node |
| Conceptual | LH is a schedule parameter, not a schedule transformer |

All notation in this specification uses the qualifier form `S LH d`. No separate denotational notation is needed — the qualifier syntax is directly used in algebraic reasoning.

The grammar reflects this: `<schedule> ::= <base_schedule> ("LH" <value>)?` places LH as a postfix clause, not as a node in `<modifier>` (where DRL, DRH, DRO reside). In the AST, LH is represented as optional `limitedHold` / `limitedHoldUnit` properties on the qualifying schedule node — not as a separate `LimitedHold` wrapper. This aligns with the behavioral literature where LH is always an attribute of a specific schedule, not applied to compound arrangements. Applying LH to a Compound schedule is a SemanticError (`LH_ON_COMPOUND`); use per-component LH or program-level `LH = Xs` default propagation instead.

DRL/DRH/DRO are modifiers because they wrap an inner schedule and impose a differential reinforcement criterion; LH qualifies when reinforcement *availability* expires after the schedule's own criterion is met.

**Position in the schedule taxonomy.** LH is a **temporal availability qualifier** — a constraint on *when* the reinforcement opportunity remains available after the schedule criterion is met. It is placed in the base grammar (not an annotation) because, like DRL, it directly determines the reinforcement function that quantitative models (matching law, behavioral momentum) depend on.

#### 1.6.1 LH Default Propagation — Attribute Grammar

The program-level `LH` parameter declaration (`LH = d`) specifies a default limited hold that propagates to eligible leaf schedule nodes. This subsection formalizes the propagation rules as an **attribute grammar** (Aho et al., 2006, §5.2), replacing the informal description "applies to all leaf base_schedules."

**Attributes.**

| Attribute | Kind | Type | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lh_default` | Synthesized | `Option<(ℝ⁺, Option<TimeUnit>)>` | `Program` node |
| `inherited_lh` | Inherited | `Option<(ℝ⁺, Option<TimeUnit>)>` | All `ScheduleExpr` nodes |
| `effective_lh` | Synthesized | `Option<(ℝ⁺, Option<TimeUnit>)>` | Leaf nodes |

- `lh_default`: extracted from `Program.param_decls`. Value is `⊥` if no `LH` declaration is present.
- `inherited_lh`: the LH default flowing top-down from the Program root through the AST.
- `effective_lh`: the LH that actually qualifies a leaf node. If `≠ ⊥`, the semantic analyzer sets `leaf.limitedHold = effective_lh`.

**Phase ordering.** LH propagation is a **semantic analysis** pass that operates on the **post-expansion** AST — after let-binding substitution and `Repeat` desugaring, but before warnings/linting. The pipeline:

```
Source → Lex → Parse → [Pre-expansion AST]
  → Binding expansion / Repeat desugaring → [Post-expansion AST]
  → LH default propagation (this AG) → [Resolved AST]
  → Warnings / Linting
```

This ordering resolves the pre/post-expansion phase ambiguity: LH propagation always operates on fully expanded ASTs, where no `IdentifierRef` or `Repeat` nodes remain.

**Propagation rules.** `⊥` denotes the absence of an LH value (no propagation).

```
R1  Program → param_decls bindings schedule
    schedule.inherited_lh = lookup("LH", param_decls)      -- ⊥ if absent

R2  Compound[C] → C(components[1..n])
    where C ∈ {Conc, Alt, Conj, Chain, Tand, Mult, Mix, Interpolate}
    ∀i ∈ [1..n]:
        components[i].inherited_lh = Compound.inherited_lh

R3  Overlay → Overlay(baseline, punisher)
    baseline.inherited_lh  = Overlay.inherited_lh
    punisher.inherited_lh  = ⊥

R4  Leaf with explicit LH: node.limitedHold ≠ ⊥
    node retains its explicit limitedHold (no override by inherited_lh)

R5  Leaf without explicit LH: node ∈ {Atomic, Special, DRModifier, SecondOrder, TrialBased}
    node.effective_lh = node.inherited_lh
    action: if effective_lh ≠ ⊥ then set node.limitedHold = effective_lh

R6  AversiveSchedule → Sidman(...) | DiscrimAv(...)
    inherited_lh is discarded (no qualification, no propagation)
```

**Summary by node type.**

| Node type | Behavior | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `Compound` (Conc, Alt, Conj, Chain, Tand, Mult, Mix, Interpolate) | Pass `inherited_lh` to each component | R2 |
| `Overlay` | Pass to baseline; punisher gets `⊥` | R3 |
| Leaf with explicit `limitedHold` | Retain explicit value (no override) | R4 |
| `Atomic`, `Special`, `DRModifier`, `SecondOrder`, `TrialBased` | Set `limitedHold` property if `inherited_lh ≠ ⊥` | R5 |
| `AversiveSchedule` (Sidman, DiscrimAv) | Discard `inherited_lh` | R6 |

**Rationale for key design decisions.**

*R3 — Overlay punisher isolation.* Program-level LH constrains reinforcement availability. The punishment contingency in an `Overlay` operates on a separate consequence class (aversive stimuli). Propagating a reinforcement-availability window to a punishment schedule would be procedurally incoherent.

*R4 — Explicit LH overrides default.* Expression-level LH (`limitedHold` property already set) overrides program-level LH, analogous to expression-level COD overriding program-level COD (§2.4). The explicit LH already provides the intended temporal constraint; propagating the default further would create unintended double-gating.

*R5 — SecondOrder as leaf.* In second-order schedules (e.g., `FR5(FI30)`), the unit schedule defines a derived response unit (Kelleher, 1966). The session-level LH constrains overall reinforcement delivery, not each unit's internal temporal dynamics. Propagating LH into the unit position would fundamentally alter the procedure — particularly in behavioral pharmacology, where the unit schedule's independent operation is often the experimental variable of interest (Goldberg & Kelleher, 1977). Setting `limitedHold` on the SecondOrder node preserves the intended semantics: "once the second-order arrangement produces a reinforcement opportunity, you have *d* seconds to collect it."

*R6 — Aversive schedule isolation.* Sidman avoidance and discriminated avoidance have dedicated temporal parameters (SSI/RSI, CSUSInterval) that govern consequence timing. LH constrains *reinforcement availability*; these schedules deliver *aversive consequences* on procedurally distinct timelines (Sidman, 1953).

**Worked examples.**

*Example 1 — Basic propagation through Conc.*
```
Input:    LH = 10s
          Conc(VI 30s, VI 60s)
Resolved: Conc(VI 30s LH 10s, VI 60s LH 10s)
```
Trace: R1 → R2 (×2) → R5 (×2, set limitedHold).

*Example 2 — Expression-level override.*
```
Input:    LH = 10s
          Conc(FR 5, VI 60s LH 20s)
Resolved: Conc(FR 5 LH 10s, VI 60s LH 20s)
```
Trace: R1 → R2 (×2). `FR 5`: R5 (set limitedHold, + `VACUOUS_LH_RATIO` warning). `VI 60s LH 20s`: R4 (explicit limitedHold already set, no override).

*Example 3 — SecondOrder unit isolation.*
```
Input:    LH = 10s
          FR 5(FI 30s)
Resolved: FR 5(FI 30s) LH 10s
```
Trace: R1 → R5 (SecondOrder treated as leaf, set limitedHold). The unit `FI 30s` is untouched; the LH window constrains when the subject can collect reinforcement after the 5th unit completion.

*Example 4 — Nested compound.*
```
Input:    LH = 10s
          Conc(Chain(FR 5, FI 30s), VI 60s)
Resolved: Conc(Chain(FR 5 LH 10s, FI 30s LH 10s), VI 60s LH 10s)
```
Trace: R1 → R2 → R2 (into Chain) → R5 (×3, set limitedHold). Each leaf independently receives the default.

*Example 5 — Aversive schedule isolation.*
```
Input:    LH = 10s
          Sidman(SSI=20s, RSI=5s)
Resolved: Sidman(SSI=20s, RSI=5s)
```
Trace: R1 → R6 (`inherited_lh` discarded).

*Example 6 — No LH param_decl (identity).*
```
Input:    Conc(VI 30s, VI 60s)
Resolved: Conc(VI 30s, VI 60s)
```
Trace: R1 (`lh_default = ⊥`). No propagation occurs.

**Conformance test suite.** `conformance/core/lh_propagation.json` provides test vectors for all propagation rules. Each test specifies both the parser output (`expected`, pre-propagation) and the resolved AST (`resolved`, post-propagation).

### 1.7 Reinforcement Delay — Response-Consequence Temporal Interval

**The problem.** The temporal interval between the response that satisfies a schedule requirement and the delivery of the consequence is a fundamental parameter of any contingency. Even brief delays — including feeder actuation time (≈0.5 s in standard operant chambers) — systematically modulate response patterns and can be confounded with schedule effects if not controlled (Lattal, 2010). This parameter must be expressible in the DSL.

**Per-schedule delay is a tandem arrangement.** In the delay-of-reinforcement literature, a delay imposed on a specific schedule is operationalized as a tandem FT requirement. Sizemore and Lattal (1978) described their procedure as: "responses on the VI 60-s schedule were followed by a tandem FT *t*-s requirement before reinforcer delivery." This is directly expressible in the DSL using existing combinators:

| Delay type | DSL expression | Semantics | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nonresetting, unsignaled | `Tand(VI 60-s, FT 5-s)` | After VI satisfaction, wait 5 s regardless of responses | Sizemore & Lattal (1978) |
| Resetting, unsignaled | `Tand(VI 60-s, DRO 5-s)` | After VI satisfaction, wait 5 s; responses restart the timer | Lattal (2010) |
| Signaled | `Chain(VI 60-s, FT 5-s)` | After VI, discriminative stimulus changes; food after 5 s | Richards (1981) |
| Differential (concurrent) | `Conc(Tand(VI 60-s, FT 1-s), Tand(VI 60-s, FT 8-s), COD=2-s)` | Each alternative has its own delay | Chung & Herrnstein (1967) |
| Adjusting (choice) | `Adj(delay, start=10-s, step=1-s)` | Delay adjusts per trial (Core-Stateful) | Mazur (1987) |

No new expression-level primitive is needed: `Tand(S, FT d)` is the established formalization of per-schedule reinforcement delay, and the DSL already supports it.

**Session-wide apparatus delay.** The remaining gap is the common case where *all* reinforcement events in a session share the same apparatus-imposed latency. This is expressed via a program-level `param_decl`:

```
RD = 500ms
VI 60-s
```

The `RD` param_decl instructs the runtime to impose a uniform delay between any schedule satisfaction event and consequence delivery. It has no expression-level syntax — when per-schedule specificity is needed, the user writes an explicit `Tand(S, FT d)`.

**Properties:**
- `RD = 0s` is legal (explicit immediate delivery).
- Time unit is mandatory (delay is intrinsically temporal).
- `RD > 30s` triggers a linter warning (most published research uses delays ≤ 30 s).
- `RD` does not specify signaling, resetting, or response-handling during the delay — those procedural details are properties of the `Tand`/`Chain`/`DRO` arrangement or runtime configuration.

**Position in the grammar.** `RD` is a `param_decl` keyword (alongside `LH`, `COD`, `FRCO`, `BO`), not a schedule expression modifier. This reflects the literature: Lattal (2010) reviews delay as a *procedural parameter* that applies to the session arrangement, while per-schedule delays are tandem schedule structures that belong in the schedule expression itself.

## Part II: Composition Algebra — Compound Schedule Combinators

### 2.1 Classifying Combinators

The compound schedules form a structured algebra over atomic schedules. We classify them along three independent semantic dimensions:

**Dimension A: Topology** — How components relate in time.
- *Parallel*: Components operate simultaneously.
- *Sequential*: Components operate in fixed order; completing one transitions to the next.
- *Alternating*: Components alternate, with transitions controlled by the environment.

**Dimension B: Discriminability** — Whether discriminative stimuli (S^D) signal transitions.
- *Discriminated*: Each component is paired with a distinct S^D.
- *Undiscriminated*: No S^D change signals transitions.

**Dimension C: Satisfaction Logic** — How component satisfaction relates to reinforcement.
- *OR (Disjunctive)*: Any one component satisfied triggers reinforcement.
- *AND (Conjunctive)*: All components must be simultaneously satisfied.
- *Independent*: Each component maintains its own reinforcement contingency.
- *Sequential*: Completion of one component is prerequisite for the next.
- *Context-switched*: Only the currently-active component's contingency applies.

This yields the complete classification:

| Schedule | Abbreviation | Topology | Discriminability | Logic | Operanda |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Concurrent | Conc | Parallel | N/A (separate) | Independent | Multiple |
| Alternative | Alt | Parallel | N/A | OR | Single |
| Conjunctive | Conj | Parallel | N/A | AND | Single |
| Chained | Chain | Sequential | Discriminated | Sequential | Single |
| Tandem | Tand | Sequential | Undiscriminated | Sequential | Single |
| Multiple | Mult | Alternating | Discriminated | Context-switched | Single |
| Mixed | Mix | Alternating | Undiscriminated | Context-switched | Single |

A structural observation: **Chain and Tand** form a discriminated/undiscriminated pair under sequential topology. **Mult and Mix** form the same pair under alternating topology. This suggests higher-level abstractions:

```
Sequential(components, discriminated: bool)
  discriminated = true   → Chain
  discriminated = false  → Tand

Alternating(components, discriminated: bool)
  discriminated = true   → Mult
  discriminated = false  → Mix
```

### 2.2 Algebraic Properties

#### 2.2.1 Equivalence Relations — Definitions

This specification uses three distinct relations on schedule expressions. All algebraic claims in this section and throughout the specification are stated under these definitions.

**Definition 1 (Syntactic equality).** Two schedule expressions `S₁` and `S₂` are *syntactically equal*, written `S₁ =_syn S₂`, if and only if their AST representations are structurally identical — i.e., every node type, combinator, parameter value, and child ordering is the same. Syntactic equality is decidable by recursive structural comparison.

**Definition 2 (Observation trace).** An *observation trace* is a finite sequence of timestamped events `τ = ⟨(e₁, t₁), (e₂, t₂), …, (eₙ, tₙ)⟩` where each `eᵢ` is either a response event or a time-tick event and `t₁ ≤ t₂ ≤ … ≤ tₙ`. Let `T` denote the set of all finite observation traces.

**Definition 3 (Reinforcement outcome sequence).** Given a schedule expression `S` and an observation trace `τ ∈ T`, the *reinforcement outcome sequence* `outcome(S, τ)` is the sequence of reinforcement decisions (reinforced / not reinforced) that `S` produces when processing `τ` from a canonical initial state `σ₀`. The canonical initial state has all counters at zero, all timers at zero, and an empty reinforcement history.

**Definition 4 (Semantic equivalence, ≡).** Two schedule expressions `S₁` and `S₂` are *semantically equivalent*, written `S₁ ≡ S₂`, if and only if they produce identical reinforcement outcome sequences for every possible observation trace:

```
S₁ ≡ S₂  ⟺  ∀τ ∈ T. outcome(S₁, τ) = outcome(S₂, τ)
```

Informally: no observer can distinguish `S₁` from `S₂` by examining reinforcement outcomes alone, regardless of the subject's behavior. Semantic equivalence is an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive). The negation is written `≢`.

**Definition 5 (Sound rewrite rule, →).** A *sound rewrite rule* `S₁ → S₂` is a directed AST transformation such that `S₁ ≡ S₂`. Rewrite rules are applied left-to-right; a conforming implementation MAY apply any sound rewrite rule as an optimization pass but MUST NOT apply unsound rewrites. The notation `S₁ ≡ S₂` implies both `S₁ → S₂` and `S₂ → S₁` are sound.

**Notation convention.** Throughout this specification:
- `≡` and `≢` denote semantic equivalence and its negation (Definition 4).
- `=` is used only in mathematical prose (e.g., `n + 1 = m`) or in informal glosses where the context makes the intended relation unambiguous.
- `=_syn` denotes syntactic equality when the distinction matters (Definition 1).

#### 2.2.2 Fundamental Theorems

**Theorem 1 (Commutativity).**
- `Conc(A, B) ≡ Conc(B, A)` — operandum assignment is arbitrary (modulo labeling).
- `Alt(A, B) ≡ Alt(B, A)` — disjunction is commutative.
- `Conj(A, B) ≡ Conj(B, A)` — conjunction is commutative.
- `Chain(A, B) ≢ Chain(B, A)` — sequential order matters.
- `Tand(A, B) ≢ Tand(B, A)` — sequential order matters.
- `Mult(A, B) ≢ Mult(B, A)` — alternation order matters.
- `Mix(A, B) ≢ Mix(B, A)` — alternation order matters.

*Proof sketch (commutativity of Alt).* For any trace `τ`, `outcome(Alt(A, B), τ)` reinforces at step `i` iff `A` or `B` would reinforce at step `i`. Since disjunction is commutative, `outcome(Alt(A, B), τ) = outcome(Alt(B, A), τ)`. ∎

*Counterexample (non-commutativity of Chain).* Consider `Chain(FR 1, FI 10-s)` vs. `Chain(FI 10-s, FR 1)`. In the first, a single response completes the FR link and transitions to the FI link. In the second, 10 seconds must elapse first. The trace `τ = ⟨(response, t=0)⟩` reinforces under neither, but `τ' = ⟨(response, t=0), (response, t=11)⟩` reinforces under the first but not the second (which requires the FI to be satisfied first, then one more response). ∎

**Theorem 2 (Associativity).** All seven combinators are associative in the sense that they flatten to N-ary compositions:
- `Conc(A, Conc(B, C)) ≡ Conc(A, B, C)`
- `Alt(A, Alt(B, C)) ≡ Alt(A, B, C)`
- `Conj(A, Conj(B, C)) ≡ Conj(A, B, C)`
- `Chain(A, Chain(B, C)) ≡ Chain(A, B, C)`
- `Tand(A, Tand(B, C)) ≡ Tand(A, B, C)`
- `Mult(A, Mult(B, C)) ≡ Mult(A, B, C)`
- `Mix(A, Mix(B, C)) ≡ Mix(A, B, C)`

**Theorem 3 (Identity Elements).**
- `Alt(S, EXT) ≡ S` — EXT is the identity for Alt (never-satisfied OR'd with S is just S).
- `Conj(S, CRF) ≡ S` — CRF (always satisfied on first response) is the identity for Conj.
- `Chain(CRF, S) ≡ S` — CRF as initial link is immediately satisfied.

**Theorem 4 (Annihilator Elements).**
- `Conj(S, EXT) ≡ EXT` — if EXT is never satisfied, the conjunction can never be satisfied.
- `Alt(S, CRF) ≡ CRF` — CRF is always satisfied first.

**Theorem 5 (Non-distributivity).** In general, compound schedule composition does NOT distribute:

```
Alt(A, Conj(B, C)) ≢ Conj(Alt(A, B), Alt(A, C))
```

This is semantically significant: parenthesization determines contingency structure and must be explicit in the DSL.

#### 2.2.3 Repeat Algebraic Properties

`Repeat(n, S)` is defined as syntactic sugar for `Tand(S, S, …, S)` with `n` copies of `S` (§1.4). The following properties are derived from the Tand desugaring and the semantic equivalence definition above.

**Theorem 6 (Repeat identity).**
```
Repeat(1, S) ≡ S
```
*Proof.* `Repeat(1, S)` desugars to `Tand(S)`, a unary tandem, which is semantically equivalent to `S` itself (a single-component sequential composition is the component). ∎

**Theorem 7 (Repeat exponent rule).**
```
Repeat(m, Repeat(n, S)) ≡ Repeat(m × n, S)
```
*Proof.* The left-hand side desugars to `m` copies of `Tand(S, …, S)` [each with `n` copies], concatenated as a tandem. By associativity of Tand (Theorem 2), this flattens to `Tand(S, …, S)` with `m × n` copies, which is `Repeat(m × n, S)`. ∎

**Theorem 8 (Repeat additive decomposition).**
```
Repeat(m + n, S) ≡ Tand(Repeat(m, S), Repeat(n, S))
```
*Proof.* Both sides desugar to `Tand(S, …, S)` with `m + n` copies by associativity of Tand. ∎

**Completeness as syntactic sugar.** `Repeat(n, S)` always expands to a finite `Tand`, so `Repeat` introduces no new semantic primitives. The meaning of any `Repeat` expression is fully determined by the `Tand` semantics.

#### 2.2.4 LH Boundary Identities

From the LH definition (§1.6):

- `S LH ∞ ≡ S` — infinite hold imposes no temporal constraint.
- `S LH 0 ≡ EXT` — zero hold makes reinforcement unavailable (the hold window closes before any response can occur).

#### 2.2.5 Sound Rewrite Rules (Summary)

The following table collects all sound rewrite rules derived from Theorems 1–8 and §1.6. A conforming implementation MAY apply these as optimization passes. The `Direction` column indicates whether the rule is applied left-to-right only (→) or is bidirectional (↔, i.e., full semantic equivalence).

| # | Rule | Direction | Priority | Theorem |
|---|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| R1 | `Alt(S, EXT) → S` | → | 1 | Thm 3 |
| R2 | `Alt(EXT, S) → S` | → | 1 | Thm 1 + Thm 3 |
| R3 | `Conj(S, CRF) → S` | → | 1 | Thm 3 |
| R4 | `Conj(CRF, S) → S` | → | 1 | Thm 1 + Thm 3 |
| R5 | `Chain(CRF, S) → S` | → | 1 | Thm 3 |
| R6 | `Conj(S, EXT) → EXT` | → | 2 | Thm 4 |
| R7 | `Conj(EXT, S) → EXT` | → | 2 | Thm 1 + Thm 4 |
| R8 | `Alt(S, CRF) → CRF` | → | 2 | Thm 4 |
| R9 | `Alt(CRF, S) → CRF` | → | 2 | Thm 1 + Thm 4 |
| R10 | `Repeat(1, S) → S` | → | 3 | Thm 6 |
| R11 | `S LH ∞ → S` | → | 3 | §1.6 |
| R12 | `S LH 0 → EXT` | → | 3 | §1.6 |
| R13 | `Conc(A, Conc(B, C)) ↔ Conc(A, B, C)` | ↔ | 4 | Thm 2 |
| R14 | `Alt(A, Alt(B, C)) ↔ Alt(A, B, C)` | ↔ | 4 | Thm 2 |
| R15 | `Conj(A, Conj(B, C)) ↔ Conj(A, B, C)` | ↔ | 4 | Thm 2 |
| R16 | `Chain(A, Chain(B, C)) ↔ Chain(A, B, C)` | ↔ | 4 | Thm 2 |
| R17 | `Tand(A, Tand(B, C)) ↔ Tand(A, B, C)` | ↔ | 4 | Thm 2 |

**Priority** indicates the recommended application order when multiple rules match. Lower numbers are applied first. Rules R1–R12 are *simplifying* (the right-hand side has fewer AST nodes); R13–R17 are *structural* (flattening nested compositions).

### 2.3 Recursive Composition

The type system supports arbitrarily nested compositions:

```
Schedule = AtomicSchedule | CompoundSchedule | ModifierSchedule
CompoundSchedule = Combinator(Schedule, Schedule, ...)
```

This is a standard recursive algebraic data type (ADT). For example:

```
Conc(Chain(FR 5, VI 60-s), Alt(FR 10, FT 30-s))
```

is a concurrent schedule where operandum 1 presents a chained FR5-then-VI 60, and operandum 2 presents an alternative FR10-or-FT 30.

### 2.4 Changeover Delay (COD) and Fixed-Ratio Changeover (FRCO)

The Changeover Delay (COD) specifies a minimum time after an operandum switch before reinforcement becomes available on the new operandum (Catania, 1966). COD is a **definitional parameter** of `Conc`, not optional metadata:

- Without COD, a concurrent schedule is procedurally underspecified (Herrnstein, 1961). The DSL emits a linter WARNING (`MISSING_COD`) recommending explicit COD specification; the runtime default is `COD=0-s`.
- `COD=0-s` is legal (explicit no-delay), matching Shull & Pliskoff (1967), but parsers SHOULD emit a lint warning for VI-VI arrangements.

```
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, COD=2-s)           -- 2-s changeover delay
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, COD=0-s)           -- explicit no-delay (control condition)
```

**Default behavior:** Symmetric (same delay regardless of switch direction), resetting (each changeover starts a fresh COD timer). This follows from the standard definition: reinforcement is withheld for a period "since the last changeover" (Catania, 1966), meaning each new changeover anchors a new timer.

**Fixed-Ratio Changeover (FRCO):** A response-based alternative to time-based COD. FRCO requires N responses on the new operandum before reinforcement becomes available (Hunter & Davison, 1985; Pliskoff & Fetterman, 1981). FRCO and COD may coexist:

```
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, FRCO=5)            -- 5 responses required after switch
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, COD=2-s, FRCO=5)   -- both time and response requirements
```

| Parameter | Alias | Dimension | Reference |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| COD | ChangeoverDelay | Time (s/ms/min) | Herrnstein (1961); Catania (1966) |
| FRCO | FixedRatioChangeover | Responses (dimensionless) | Hunter & Davison (1985) |

**Terminology note.** Earlier drafts used the abbreviation `COR` (Changeover Response). The established literature abbreviation is **FRCO**, introduced by Hunter & Davison (1985). Pliskoff & Fetterman (1981) used the descriptive term "changeover requirement" without a fixed abbreviation.

Both COD and FRCO support program-level defaults via `param_decl` (analogous to `LH = 10-s`):

```
COD = 2-s                              -- applies to all Conc in this program
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s)                    -- inherits COD=2-s
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, COD=5-s)           -- expression-level overrides program-level
```

**Directional COD.** When changeover costs differ by switch direction, COD accepts a directional form specifying the (from, to) component pair and the delay for that transition (Pliskoff, 1971; Williams & Bell, 1999). Direction references may use 1-indexed integers or `let`-bound identifiers:

```
-- Fully explicit directional (index-based)
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, COD(1->2)=2-s, COD(2->1)=5-s)

-- Base + override: "COD was 2s, except from VR 20 it was 5s"
Conc(VI 30-s, VR 20, COD=2-s, COD(2->1)=5-s)

-- With let-bound labels (self-documenting)
let interval = VI 30-s
let ratio    = VR 20
Conc(interval, ratio, COD(interval->ratio)=1-s, COD(ratio->interval)=3-s)
```

**Base + override semantics.** Scalar `COD=Xs` provides a base delay for all unspecified directions. Directional entries `COD(x->y)=Ys` override specific transitions. This maps to the common JEAB Method section phrasing: "The COD was 2 s, except for switches from the VR 20 schedule, where it was 5 s."

Semantic rules for directional COD:
- `dir_ref` as integer must be in range [1, N]. As identifier, must resolve to a `let`-bound component name.
- Self-referencing direction (`COD(1->1)`) → `DIRECTIONAL_SELF_REFERENCE`.
- Duplicate direction pair → `DUPLICATE_DIRECTIONAL_KW`.
- Directional form valid for COD on Conc only; other keyword args → `INVALID_DIRECTIONAL_KW`.
- Program-level `param_decl` accepts scalar COD only (symmetric base). Expression-level directional COD overrides specific directions.
- Per-value validation: same rules as scalar COD (time unit required, ≥ 0).

**Future (v1.2):** Resetting COD (timer restarts on re-switch during active COD).

**Note on behavioral consequences.** The behavioral consequences of COD vs FRCO are asymmetric — see Hunter & Davison (1985) and Pliskoff & Fetterman (1981) for the empirical dissociation of their effects on generalized matching law sensitivity. COD typically produces undermatching (a < 1), while FRCO typically produces overmatching (a > 1) in concurrent VI VI preparations. This DSL encodes both as procedural parameters and delegates outcome prediction to downstream analyzers.

### 2.5 Blackout (BO)

The Blackout (BO) specifies a response-independent dark period inserted between component transitions in **Multiple** and **Mixed** schedules. Unlike COD (which is response-contingent and Conc-specific), BO is not contingent on any response and serves as a methodological control for inter-component behavioral independence.

**Design rationale.** BO directly affects behavioral contrast (Reynolds, 1961): longer BO periods reduce inter-component interaction, producing cleaner discrimination between components. From an associative learning perspective, BO duration determines whether prior-component stimulus representations decay sufficiently to prevent generalization across components (Bouton, 2004; Wagner, 1981). This makes BO a **structural parameter of Mult/Mix**, not mere session metadata — structurally symmetric with COD's role in Conc.

```
Mult(FR 5, EXT, BO=5-s)               -- 5-s blackout between components
Mix(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, BO=3-s)            -- 3-s blackout (undiscriminated)
Mult(FR 5, EXT)                       -- no blackout (immediate transition)
```

**Default behavior:** BO is optional (unlike COD). Omission or `BO=0-s` means immediate component transition with no blackout period. Symmetric (same duration for all transitions).

**Future (v1.2):** Asymmetric BO (different values per transition direction, e.g., Rich→Lean vs. Lean→Rich). To be designed in conjunction with asymmetric COD (Issue #25).

**Relationship to Timeout (TO).** BO is response-independent; TO is response-contingent. TO functions as negative punishment (removal of positive reinforcement contingent on a response). See §2.5.1 for the full TO specification and the operational distinction from BO and DRO.

### 2.5.1 Timeout (TO)

Timeout is a response-contingent period during which positive reinforcement is not available (Leitenberg, 1965). TO functions as negative punishment: the organism's response produces a period of reinforcement unavailability.

**Operational definition.** When the target response occurs, the base schedule's reinforcement availability is suspended for the specified duration. If `reset_on_response=true`, any response during TO restarts the timer (resetting TO). If `reset_on_response=false`, the timer runs independently of responding (non-resetting TO).

**Syntax.** TO is a postfix qualifier on schedule expressions, following the same positional pattern as LH:

```
VI 60-s TO(duration=30-s, reset_on_response=true)

-- Combined with LH
FI 30-s LH 10-s TO(duration=20-s, reset_on_response=false)

-- Per-component in concurrent schedule
Conc(
  VI 30-s TO(duration=15-s, reset_on_response=true),
  VI 60-s,
  COD=2-s
)
```

**Structural relationships.**

| | TO | DRO | BO |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Contingency** | Response-contingent | Response-contingent | Response-independent |
| **Function** | Negative punishment (removes SR+) | Positive reinforcement (delivers SR+ for omission) | Procedural (component transition) |
| **Timer reset** | Configurable (`reset_on_response`) | Always resetting (by definition) | N/A |
| **DSL position** | Postfix on schedule | Modifier (standalone or in Tand) | Keyword arg on Mult/Mix |

Resetting TO (`reset_on_response=true`) and DRO share identical contingency structures: "if no target response occurs for duration *d*, then [consequence]." The difference is the consequence polarity: TO restores reinforcement availability (end of punishment), DRO delivers reinforcement (positive reinforcement). This structural equivalence is noted in defaults.md.

**Environmental determinants.** Solnick, Rincover, & Peterson (1977) demonstrated that TO's effectiveness as punishment depends on the time-in environment quality. When time-in provides rich reinforcement, TO functions as an aversive event; when time-in is impoverished, TO may function as reinforcement (escape from aversive stimulation). The DSL captures the procedural structure of TO but does not model environmental quality — this is deferred to the annotation layer (e.g., `@timeout_condition("dark_chamber")`).

### 2.5.2 Response Cost

Response cost is a response-contingent removal of a conditioned reinforcer (Kazdin, 1972; Weiner, 1962). Like TO, it functions as negative punishment, but the operational structure is distinct: TO suspends reinforcement *availability* for a duration, whereas response cost *subtracts* a fixed quantity of a previously delivered conditioned reinforcer (token, point) at the moment of the target response.

**Operational definition.** When the target response occurs, a fixed amount of a conditioned reinforcer is removed from the subject's accumulated supply. The contingency is discrete (one response → one subtraction event), not temporal. The DSL describes only the contingency relation; the token supply itself, its initial endowment, bankruptcy handling, and between-session carryover are all recording-layer concerns, outside the static contingency structure.

**Syntax.** Response cost is a postfix qualifier on schedule expressions, following LH and TO:

```
VI 60-s ResponseCost(amount=1)

-- Weiner (1962) replication: points as unit
VI 60-s ResponseCost(amount=1, unit="point")

-- Per-component in concurrent schedule
Conc(
  VI 30-s ResponseCost(amount=2),
  VI 60-s,
  COD=2-s
)

-- Combined with LH and TO
FI 30-s LH 10-s TO(duration=20-s, reset_on_response=false) ResponseCost(amount=1)
```

**Operational distinction from TO.**

| | TO | Response Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Operation** | Suspension of reinforcement availability | Removal of accumulated conditioned reinforcer |
| **Temporal profile** | Duration (period) | Discrete (instantaneous) |
| **Recorded state** | Timer | Token/point supply (recording-layer) |
| **Canonical context** | Experimental research | Token economy, human operant |
| **Quadrant** | Negative punishment (SP−) | Negative punishment (SP−) |

Both TO and response cost are instances of negative punishment, but they act on different referents: TO acts on the *future* (reinforcement that has not yet been earned becomes inaccessible for a time), response cost acts on the *past* (a conditioned reinforcer already delivered is reclaimed). Leitenberg (1965) drew the original operational distinction; Kazdin (1972) synthesized the response cost literature.

**Declarative-only contract.** The DSL declares the contingency `response → remove amount of unit`. It does not declare:

- Initial token endowment (belongs to the session/protocol layer).
- Behavior at zero balance (bankruptcy, response blocking, session termination — all recording-layer policy).
- Between-session carryover of token balance.
- Conversion ratio of tokens to primary reinforcers (belongs to `@reinforcer` annotations or a token-economy extension).

This matches the DSL's broader stance on state: within-session state machines are internal to the schedule's denotation (§2.13), but longitudinal state accumulation (balances, histories, bankruptcies) is deferred to the recording/execution layer.

**Relation to token reinforcement.** Response cost operates on a conditioned reinforcer — there must be *something* to remove. Declaration of the conditioned reinforcer via `@reinforcer` annotations is recommended but not required. A program that uses `ResponseCost(...)` without any `@reinforcer` annotation triggers a linter warning (`RC_WITHOUT_TOKEN_CONTEXT`; grammar.ebnf constraint §96), noting that the removed token is otherwise underspecified. The warning does not distinguish primary from conditioned reinforcers — a program declaring `@reinforcer("food")` (primary) would suppress the warning even though food is not a token. Refining this requires a reinforcer-type annotation extension beyond the core DSL. Hackenberg (2009) synthesized the contemporary token reinforcement literature, in which "token" is the dominant term; `unit="token"` is therefore the default, with `unit="point"` retained for fidelity to Weiner (1962, 1963).

**Empirical anchors.** Weiner (1962) demonstrated that response cost produces differential suppression across schedule types (VI and FI), with the contingency structure (per-response subtraction) orthogonal to the schedule structure (interval arrangement). Weiner (1963) further showed that point-loss contingencies can maintain human avoidance and escape responding in the absence of shock, establishing response cost as a general aversive control procedure. Kazdin (1972) reviewed the clinical literature and located response cost as the dominant mechanism of behavioral suppression in token economies. Hackenberg (2009) synthesized the contemporary token reinforcement literature.

### 2.6 Choice Behavior and the Procedure–Effect Boundary

A concurrent VR-VR schedule produces qualitatively different choice behavior from a concurrent VI-VI schedule. Under concurrent VI-VI, organisms typically allocate responses in proportion to the relative reinforcement rate — the **matching law** (Herrnstein, 1961). Under concurrent VR-VR, organisms tend to allocate nearly all responses to the richer alternative — **exclusive choice** (Herrnstein & Loveland, 1975; Baum, Aparicio, & Alonso-Alvarez, 2022).

**Design decision.** The DSL does **not** encode this distinction. `Conc` remains a single, generic combinator regardless of the component schedule types. This is deliberate and reflects a fundamental architectural principle:

> **The DSL specifies the procedure — what the experimenter arranges. It does not predict the effect — what the organism does.**

The rationale:

1. **Procedural completeness.** `Conc(VR 20, VR 40, COD=2-s)` fully specifies the operative contingency: two ratio schedules, simultaneously available, with a 2-second changeover delay. No additional parameter is needed to make this a well-formed procedure.

2. **Empirical contingency of the effect.** Whether exclusive choice actually occurs depends on parameters that the DSL already captures (ratio values, COD, FRCO) as well as factors outside the DSL's scope (training history, session duration, species). Baking `choice_mode = "exclusive"` into the DSL would assert an empirical generalization as if it were a logical entailment of the procedure. It is not.

3. **Mechanistic derivability.** The VI-VI / VR-VR difference arises from the molecular contingency structure: VI schedules differentially reinforce longer inter-response times (IRTs), while VR schedules reinforce independently of IRT. This makes switching profitable under VI (uncollected reinforcers accumulate on the unattended alternative) but not under VR. Since the component schedule types are already encoded in the DSL expression, a downstream analysis layer can derive the expected choice pattern without redundant annotation.

**Where choice analysis belongs.** Choice allocation, exclusive-choice detection, and choice-mode classification are the responsibility of the **session-analyzer** layer, which operates on observed behavioral data:

| Concept | Layer | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Schedule structure (`Conc(VR 20, VR 40, COD=2-s)`) | DSL | Procedural specification |
| Reinforcement gating (COD suppression, ratio counting) | Runtime (`contingency-py`) | Contingency enforcement |
| Choice allocation, matching parameters, exclusive-choice detection | session-analyzer | Behavioral measurement and classification |

This three-layer separation ensures that the DSL remains a precise notation for contingencies, the runtime faithfully implements those contingencies, and the analyzer characterizes behavioral outcomes without contaminating the procedural specification.

### 2.7 Aversive Schedules — Sidman Free-Operant Avoidance

The reinforcement schedule matrix (dist × domain = F/V/R × R/I/T) captures
the vast majority of positive reinforcement procedures. However, a class of
aversive control procedures — most prominently **Sidman (1953) free-operant
avoidance** — has a contingency structure that does not fit this matrix:
two temporal parameters with distinct semantics, and a response-contingent
rescheduling rule that differs from ratio / interval / time schedules.

The DSL therefore introduces a dedicated primitive, `Sidman`, in the
`aversive_schedule` production (grammar.ebnf). This is an additive Core
extension under design-philosophy §8.1.

**Procedural definition.** Two temporal parameters:

- **SSI (Shock-Shock Interval)**: baseline time between shocks in the absence
  of any response.
- **RSI (Response-Shock Interval)**: postponement time triggered by each response.

The next shock time is computed as:

```
next_shock(t) = max(last_shock_time + SSI, last_response_time + RSI)
```

In the absence of responses, shocks occur every SSI seconds. Each response
resets the next shock to occur at `last_response + RSI`, i.e., at least RSI
seconds from the response. When RSI ≤ SSI, responses can successfully
postpone shocks.

**Syntax.**

```
Sidman(SSI=20-s, RSI=5-s)                             -- primary form
SidmanAvoidance(SSI=20-s, RSI=5-s)                    -- verbose alias
Sidman(ShockShockInterval=20-s, ResponseShockInterval=5-s)  -- verbose params
```

Both parameters are required; there is no default. Time units are mandatory.

**Composition with other schedules.** `Sidman` is a `base_schedule` and may
appear inside any compound combinator:

```
Chain(FR 10 @punisher("food"), Sidman(SSI=20-s, RSI=5-s) @punisher("shock"))
```

This is a chained schedule in which completing an FR 10 for food transitions
the subject into a free-operant avoidance component (de Waard, Galizio, &
Baron, 1979).

**Semantic constraints.**

- Both `SSI` and `RSI` must be specified. Missing either → `MISSING_SIDMAN_PARAM`.
- Both must carry a time unit. Dimensionless values → `SIDMAN_TIME_UNIT_REQUIRED`.
- Both must be strictly positive. Non-positive → `SIDMAN_NONPOSITIVE_PARAM`.
- `RSI > SSI` triggers a linter WARNING `RSI_EXCEEDS_SSI`: when RSI exceeds
  SSI, responses cannot actually postpone shocks below the SSI baseline
  (Sidman, 1953; Hineline, 1977).

**Stimulus annotation.** Sidman procedures are aversive by definition. The
recommended practice is to use `@punisher` to make the experimenter's intent
explicit in source, though `@reinforcer` is accepted as an equivalent alias
(see annotation-design.md §3.5):

```
Sidman(SSI=20-s, RSI=5-s) @punisher("shock", intensity="0.5mA")
Sidman(SSI=20-s, RSI=5-s) @reinforcer("shock", intensity="0.5mA")  -- equivalent
```

**Scope of v1.x aversive schedules.** The `aversive_schedule` production is
additive. v1.x includes `Sidman` (free-operant avoidance) and
`DiscriminatedAvoidance` (trial-based avoidance). Punishment overlay is
expressed via the `Overlay` combinator (§2.10). Simple escape (response
terminates ongoing aversive stimulus without a predictive CS) can be
approximated with existing constructs using stimulus annotations.

### 2.8 Lag Schedule — Operant Variability

The differential reinforcement modifiers DRL, DRH, and DRO all operate on a
**temporal** dimension (inter-response time). A different kind of
differential reinforcement operates on **response variability** itself:
**Page & Neuringer (1985)** introduced the **Lag schedule**, in which a
response (or response sequence) is reinforced only if it differs from each
of the previous *n* responses. This demonstrated that variability is itself
an operant dimension — a behavioral property that can be strengthened by
contingent reinforcement like any other dimension.

The DSL introduces `Lag` as a differential reinforcement modifier in the
`modifier` production (grammar.ebnf), alongside DRL/DRH/DRO/PR/Repeat. This
is an additive Core extension under design-philosophy §8.1.

**Procedural definition.**

- **n**: the number of previous responses/sequences to compare against.
  `Lag 1` reinforces if the current response differs from the immediately
  previous one. `Lag 5` reinforces if it differs from each of the previous 5.
- **length** (optional, default = 1): the size of the response unit.
  `length=1` treats each individual response as the unit (the applied
  research default). `length=8` treats each 8-response sequence as the unit
  (Page & Neuringer, 1985 used this for 2-key 8-peck sequences).

Formally, let S(t) be the response unit at time t. Reinforcement is
delivered if and only if:

```
S(t) ∉ { S(t-1), S(t-2), ..., S(t-n) }
```

**Syntax.**

```
Lag 5                       -- shorthand, matches literature "Lag 5" notation;
                               length defaults to 1 (individual response unit)
Lag(5)                      -- parenthesized equivalent of Lag 5
Lag(5, length=8)            -- Page & Neuringer (1985) style 8-peck sequence
Lag(50, length=8)           -- Page & Neuringer (1985) Experiment 3 high Lag
```

The parameter `n` is positional to match the literature notation ("Lag 5",
"Lag 10"). The optional keyword argument `length` is the response-unit size.

**Semantic constraints.**

- `n` must be a non-negative integer. `Lag 0` is legal and is semantically
  equivalent to CRF (no variability requirement).
- `n` must NOT carry a time unit. `Lag 5s` → `LAG_UNEXPECTED_TIME_UNIT`.
  Lag is categorical / sequence-based; no established variant uses a time
  dimension (see `ShockShockInterval` for time-based reinforcement via
  aversive-schedule primitives, or DRL/DRH for time-based differential
  reinforcement).
- `length`, if specified, must be a positive integer (>= 1). Omission
  implies `length = 1`.
- Large `n` (> 50) triggers a linter WARNING `LAG_LARGE_N`. Historical
  research uses n <= 50.

**Stimulus annotation.** Lag works with `@reinforcer` like any other
schedule:

```
Lag(5, length=8)
  @reinforcer("grain")
  @operandum("left_key") @operandum("right_key")
```

**Composition.** Lag is a modifier and may appear inside any compound
combinator. A common pattern is to use `Mult` to alternate variability
training with a CRF baseline:

```
Mult(Lag(5, length=8), CRF)
```

**Historical notes.**

- The primary research unit in Page & Neuringer (1985) is the
  **response sequence**; `length = 1` (individual response) is formally a
  degenerate sequence and corresponds to applied research use cases (mand
  and tact variability training; Miller & Neuringer, 2000; Lee, McComas, &
  Jawor, 2002; Rodriguez et al., 2011).
- There is no established Lag schedule variant that uses a time dimension.
  Time-based variability research uses different procedures: response
  duration differential reinforcement (Platt, 1973), IRT distributions via
  percentile schedules (Alleman & Platt, 1973), or DRD.
- `Lag 0` ≡ CRF is a boundary case preserved for consistency. It declares
  the user's intent ("this is a Lag schedule with no variability
  requirement") rather than being optimized away at parse time.

**Why `length` is explicit.** The literature shows no standard sequence length (Page & Neuringer, 1985: 8; Ribeiro et al., 2022: 5; applied research: 1). The DSL exposes `length` because no single default is universally appropriate.

### 2.9 Discriminated Avoidance

Sidman free-operant avoidance (§2.7) has no warning signal — shocks occur
on a temporal cycle that the organism can only postpone. **Discriminated
avoidance** (Solomon & Wynne, 1953) introduces a conditioned stimulus (CS)
that predicts the unconditioned stimulus (US). A response during the CS
prevents the US (avoidance trial); failure to respond results in US delivery
(escape or failure trial).

The two paradigms represent distinct contingency structures:
- **Sidman (free-operant):** no CS, response postpones the next US by RSI.
- **Discriminated (trial-based):** CS predicts US at a fixed CSUSInterval;
  response during the CS cancels the US.

The DSL introduces `DiscriminatedAvoidance` (alias `DiscrimAv`) as a second
aversive-schedule primitive in the `aversive_schedule` production.

**Procedural definition.**

- **CSUSInterval** (required): time from CS onset to US onset. If the
  subject responds before this interval elapses, the US is cancelled
  (avoidance trial).
- **ITI** (required): inter-trial interval, measured CS-onset to
  next-CS-onset. Must be > CSUSInterval.
- **mode** (required): `fixed` or `escape`.
  - `fixed`: US is presented for a fixed `ShockDuration`.
  - `escape`: US continues until the subject responds. Optional `MaxShock`
    sets a safety cutoff.
- **ShockDuration** (required for mode=fixed): duration of the fixed US.
- **MaxShock** (optional for mode=escape): safety cutoff for escape-
  terminated US. Solomon & Wynne (1953) used a 2-minute cutoff.

**Syntax.**

```
DiscriminatedAvoidance(CSUSInterval=10-s, ITI=3-min, mode=escape)
DiscriminatedAvoidance(CSUSInterval=10-s, ITI=3-min, mode=escape, MaxShock=2-min)
DiscriminatedAvoidance(CSUSInterval=10-s, ITI=3-min, mode=fixed, ShockDuration=0.5-s)
DiscrimAv(CSUSInterval=10-s, ITI=3-min, mode=escape)  -- short alias
```

**Semantic constraints.**

- `CSUSInterval`, `ITI`, and `mode` must all be specified. Missing any →
  `MISSING_DA_PARAM`.
- All temporal params must carry a time unit. Dimensionless → `DA_TIME_UNIT_REQUIRED`.
- All temporal values must be strictly positive. Non-positive → `DA_NONPOSITIVE_PARAM`.
- `ITI` must be > `CSUSInterval` → `DA_ITI_TOO_SHORT`.
- `mode=fixed` requires `ShockDuration` → `MISSING_SHOCK_DURATION`.
- Cross-mode parameter exclusion → `INVALID_PARAM_FOR_MODE`.
- Unknown mode value → `DA_INVALID_MODE`.

**Stimulus annotation.** Like Sidman, discriminated avoidance is aversive by
definition. `@punisher` is recommended:

```
DiscrimAv(CSUSInterval=10-s, ITI=3-min, mode=escape, MaxShock=2-min)
  @punisher("shock", intensity="1.0mA")
  @sd("light", modality="visual")
```

**Composition.** `DiscriminatedAvoidance` is a `base_schedule` and may
appear inside any compound combinator:

```
Chain(FR 10, DiscrimAv(CSUSInterval=10-s, ITI=3-min, mode=escape))
```

### 2.10 Punishment Overlay

The `Overlay` combinator superimposes a punishment contingency on an
existing reinforcement baseline. This is the standard paradigm for studying
the effects of response-contingent aversive stimulation on maintained
operant behavior (Azrin & Holz, 1966).

**Procedural definition.** The baseline schedule continues to deliver
reinforcers. Simultaneously, the punisher schedule delivers aversive stimuli
contingent on the same responses. Both schedules share a single response
stream.

**Syntax.**

```
Overlay(VI 60-s, FR 1)                     -- every response punished
Overlay(Conc(VI 60-s, VI 180-s, COD=2-s), FR 1)  -- concurrent baseline
Overlay(Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, COD=2-s), FR 1, target=changeover)
                                           -- punishment on changeover only
```

The first component is the reinforcement baseline; the second is the
punishment schedule.

**Semantic constraints.**

- Exactly 2 positional components. More than 2 → `OVERLAY_REQUIRES_TWO`.
- Only the `target` keyword arg is permitted. Any other keyword arg →
  `INVALID_KEYWORD_ARG`.

**Response-class targeting (`target` kw_arg).**

- `target=all` (default): the punisher schedule applies to every response
  in the baseline. Omitting `target` is identical to `target=all`.
- `target=changeover`: the punisher schedule applies only to changeover
  responses (transitions between concurrent components). Requires the
  baseline to be a `Conc` combinator; non-Conc baseline →
  `TARGET_REQUIRES_CONC`. Models Todorov (1971), where punishment was
  added to the switching response in a concurrent VI VI arrangement.
- `target` is valid on `Overlay` only → `INVALID_OVERLAY_TARGET` otherwise.
  Duplicate `target` → `DUPLICATE_KEYWORD_ARG`.

**Stimulus annotation.** Use `@punisher` for the aversive stimulus and
`@reinforcer` for the baseline:

```
Overlay(VI 60-s, FR 1)
  @reinforcer("food")
  @punisher("shock", intensity="0.5mA")
```

### 2.10.1 Response-Class-Specific Punishment (`PUNISH` directive)

`PUNISH` is a `Conc` keyword argument that attaches a punishment schedule
to a specific response class *within* a concurrent arrangement. Unlike
`Overlay + target=changeover` (which applies a single punisher to a single
response class), `PUNISH` supports **heterogeneous** punishers across
multiple response classes within one `Conc` expression, including
asymmetric directional punishment (Todorov, 1971) and component-specific
punishment (de Villiers, 1980).

**Syntax.**

```
-- Asymmetric directional punishment (Todorov, 1971, Exp. 1–2)
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, COD=2-s,
     PUNISH(1->2)=FR 1, PUNISH(2->1)=FR 1)

-- Changeover shorthand (all changeover directions)
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, COD=2-s, PUNISH(changeover)=FR 1)

-- Component-targeted punishment (de Villiers, 1980)
Conc(VI 30-s, VI 60-s, COD=2-s, PUNISH(1)=VI 30-s)

-- Let-bound identifiers
let rich = VI 30-s
let lean = VI 60-s
Conc(rich, lean, COD=2-s, PUNISH(rich->lean)=FR 1)
```

The value of `PUNISH` is a **schedule expression** (atomic, compound,
modifier, or special), not a value expression. This is the structural
distinction from `scalar_kw_arg` (COD, FRCO, BO) and `directional_kw_arg`
(COD), which take a numeric value.

**Target modes.**

1. `PUNISH(changeover)`: punisher applied to all changeover transitions.
   Mutually exclusive with directional entries.
2. `PUNISH(x->y)`: punisher applied to transitions from component *x* to
   component *y*. Multiple directional entries may coexist (enumerate
   asymmetric directions explicitly rather than combining with `changeover`).
3. `PUNISH(n)`: punisher applied to all responses on component *n*,
   regardless of source. Independent of directional entries; may coexist.

**Semantic constraints (summary).**

- Conc-only → `INVALID_PUNISH_COMBINATOR` on other combinators.
- `dir_ref` resolution: 1-indexed integer or let-bound identifier
  (shares resolution rules with directional COD).
- Self-reference `PUNISH(1->1)` → `PUNISH_SELF_REFERENCE`.
- Duplicate target → `DUPLICATE_PUNISH_DIRECTIVE`.
- `PUNISH(changeover)` + `PUNISH(x->y)` → `PUNISH_TARGET_CONFLICT`.
- Out-of-range component index → `DIRECTIONAL_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE`
  (shared with COD).
- Nested PUNISH inside a PUNISH schedule → `NESTED_PUNISH_DIRECTIVE`.

**When to use PUNISH vs. Overlay + target.**

| Scenario | Use |
|---|---|
| Single punisher on all responses | `Overlay(baseline, punisher)` |
| Single punisher on all changeovers | `Overlay(Conc(...), punisher, target=changeover)` |
| Asymmetric punishers per direction | `PUNISH(1->2)=..., PUNISH(2->1)=...` |
| Component-specific punishment | `PUNISH(n)=...` |
| Mixed direction + component | `PUNISH(1->2)=..., PUNISH(2)=...` |

  schedules.

  suppression in human punishment choice.

### 2.11 Second-Order Schedules

A **second-order schedule** composes two atomic schedules into two hierarchical roles (Kelleher, 1966; Kelleher & Fry, 1962):

- **Unit schedule** — the inner schedule that defines a *derived response unit*. Each completion of the unit schedule counts as one unit.
- **Overall schedule** — the outer schedule that arranges reinforcement contingent on unit completions.

```
SecondOrder = Overall(Unit)
Overall     = AtomicSchedule          -- parametric only (no EXT, CRF)
Unit        = AtomicSchedule          -- simple schedules only (v1.0, frozen)
```

**Unit constraint (v1.0 frozen).** The unit position accepts only simple (atomic) schedules. Compound schedules such as `Chain(FR3, FI10)` or `Conc(FR5, FI30)` are rejected with `INVALID_SECOND_ORDER_UNIT`. This constraint is frozen for v1.x based on a survey of the historical literature: Kelleher (1966), Malagodi, DeWeese & Johnston (1973), and Jwaideh (1973) all employ simple-inside-simple arrangements exclusively. No published second-order schedule experiment uses a compound inner schedule. Future extension, if warranted by new experimental procedures, would be additive (design-philosophy §7.1) and eligible for a minor version bump.

**Syntax example.** `FR5(FI30)` means: treat each completion of FI 30-s as one unit; reinforce after 5 such unit completions.

**Critical semantic constraint.** In the overall position, the `value` field is always interpreted as a **unit completion count** — the number of times the unit schedule must be completed — *not* as an individual response count. A standalone `FR5` counts 5 individual responses; `FR5(FI30)` counts 5 completions of FI 30-s. The notation is intentionally shared, but the operand differs: the overall schedule operates on the derived response unit defined by the unit schedule (Kelleher & Fry, 1962, p. 544).

This distinction is procedurally essential. If the overall were interpreted as a response count, `FR5(FI30)` would reduce to a simple FR 5 that happens to ignore the unit schedule — a degenerate and experimentally meaningless arrangement.

#### 2.11.1 Operational Semantics

**FR-overall desugaring.** When the overall schedule is a ratio schedule (FR, VR, RR), the second-order schedule is reducible to tandem composition without brief stimuli:

```
FR_n(S) ≡ Repeat(n, S) ≡ Tand(S, S, …, S)    [n copies]
```

This equivalence holds because the ratio-overall counts unit completions deterministically and does not impose temporal structure on the completion sequence (Kelleher & Gollub, 1962). Note: this equivalence holds only in the absence of brief stimulus presentation between unit completions; with brief stimuli (conditioned reinforcers), the second-order arrangement produces different behavioral effects than a simple tandem.

**Interval/Time-overall: irreducible primitive.** When the overall schedule is an interval or time schedule (FI, VI, RI, FT, VT, RT), the second-order schedule is **not reducible** to tandem composition. The overall schedule controls the *temporal distribution* of reinforcement across unit completions, which requires a stateful primitive.

**State machine.** For all `SecondOrder(Overall, Unit)` arrangements:

```
State: (unit_state, overall_state, unit_completion_count)

Initialize:
  unit_state     = Unit.initial()
  overall_state  = Overall.initial()
  unit_completion_count = 0

On response event (obs):
  unit_result = Unit.evaluate(unit_state, obs)
  if unit_result.satisfied:
    unit_completion_count += 1
    unit_state = Unit.initial()                -- reset unit
    overall_result = Overall.evaluate(overall_state, unit_completion_event)
    if overall_result.satisfied:
      deliver_primary_reinforcer()
      overall_state = Overall.initial()        -- reset overall
      unit_completion_count = 0
    else:
      deliver_brief_stimulus()                 -- conditioned reinforcer (if configured)
  else:
    unit_state = unit_result.next_state
```

**Overall clock reset rule.** The overall schedule's internal timer resets after each primary reinforcement delivery. For `FI120(FR10)`: after the primary reinforcer, the FI 120-s clock restarts from zero. This follows the standard usage in the behavioral pharmacology literature (Goldberg, Kelleher, & Morse, 1975).

**Per-domain behavior.**

| Overall domain | Criterion for `overall_result.satisfied` | Reducible? |
|---|---|---|
| Ratio (FR, VR, RR) | `unit_completion_count == Overall.value` | Yes → `Repeat(n, Unit)` |
| Interval (FI, VI, RI) | `elapsed_since_last_reinforcement ≥ Overall.value` AND a unit completion occurs | No |
| Time (FT, VT, RT) | `elapsed_since_last_reinforcement ≥ Overall.value` (response-independent) | No |

**Brief stimulus requirement (constraint §74).** A `SecondOrder` expression without a `@brief` annotation — at either the schedule level or the program level — triggers a linter WARNING (`MISSING_BRIEF`). This is not a SemanticError; the program remains valid and parseable.

The brief stimulus (conditioned reinforcer) is a defining independent variable of second-order schedules (Kelleher, 1966). Its presence or absence fundamentally alters the behavioral function of the arrangement: with brief stimuli, the second-order schedule maintains extended sequences of behavior through conditioned reinforcement; without them, a ratio-overall second-order schedule reduces to a tandem (§2.11.1 above). In drug self-administration research, brief stimuli are nearly universally employed (Goldberg, Kelleher, & Morse, 1975).

To suppress the warning, the user must provide one of:

- `@brief("stimulus_id")` — specifying the brief stimulus identity (with optional `duration` parameter)
- `@brief(none)` — explicitly opting out of brief stimulus presentation

The `@brief(none)` form signals that the user has considered and deliberately excluded the conditioned reinforcer. Its semantics are identical to bare omission (no brief stimulus between unit completions), but the intent is documented in the source. This follows the same design philosophy as `MISSING_COD` for `Conc` (grammar.ebnf constraint §7): procedurally essential information that is permitted to omit, but flagged to encourage explicit specification.

### 2.12 Type Safety

This section establishes that well-formed contingency-dsl programs do not produce type errors during semantic analysis. The argument follows Pierce (2002, TAPL §8.3) adapted to the DSL's three-phase compilation pipeline.

#### 2.12.1 AST Phases and Type Discipline

Three phases transform the AST, each with a distinct type universe. Phase-specific JSON Schemas enforce these type universes at the schema level (I-6: Phase Distinction):

| Phase | Name | Type universe | JSON Schema | Key property |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Pre-expansion | `ScheduleExpr` (all 8 branches, incl. `IdentifierRef`, `RepeatModifier`) | `ast-parsed.schema.json` | May contain unresolved references |
| Phase 2 | Post-expansion | `ScheduleExpr \ {IdentifierRef, RepeatModifier}` | `ast-resolved.schema.json` | All references resolved, Repeat desugared |
| Phase 3 | Resolved | Phase 2 + LH wrapping (§1.6.1) | `ast-resolved.schema.json` | Program-level defaults propagated |

The universal schema `ast.schema.json` accepts ASTs from any phase. Phase-specific schemas provide stronger guarantees:
- **`ast-parsed.schema.json`** validates Phase 1 parser output. `ScheduleExpr.oneOf` includes `IdentifierRef`; `Modifier.oneOf` includes `RepeatModifier`.
- **`ast-resolved.schema.json`** validates Phase 2/3 output. `ScheduleExpr.oneOf` excludes `IdentifierRef`; `Modifier.oneOf` excludes `RepeatModifier`; `Program.bindings` is constrained to `maxItems: 0`.

Execution engines SHOULD validate against `ast-resolved.schema.json` to reject unresolved ASTs. Parsers SHOULD validate output against `ast-parsed.schema.json`.

Each phase transition is total: it either succeeds (producing a well-typed AST in the target phase) or fails with a semantic error. No partial ASTs are returned (§3.7).

#### 2.12.2 Typing Rules

**Phase 1 → Phase 2 (Binding expansion).**

```
Γ = {x₁ : τ₁, ..., xₖ : τₖ}     (binding environment)

Γ ⊢ e : ScheduleExpr    x ∉ dom(Γ)    Γ ⊢ v : ScheduleExpr
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Γ, x : v ⊢ e[x ↦ v] : ScheduleExpr

Γ ⊢ IdentifierRef(x) : ScheduleExpr    iff x ∈ dom(Γ)
```

Three static constraints ensure termination and decidability:
1. **No shadowing:** each binding name is unique → no ambiguity in Γ.
2. **No forward references:** `x_k` only references `{x₁, ..., x_{k-1}}` → acyclic substitution.
3. **Top-level only:** no nested `let` → single-pass expansion.

Under these constraints, binding expansion always terminates and produces a Phase 2 AST free of `IdentifierRef` nodes.

**Repeat desugaring** is also guaranteed to terminate: `Repeat(n, S)` with `n ≥ 1` (enforced by the value constraint in ast-schema.json) expands to `Tand(S, …, S)` with `n` copies.

**Phase 2 → Phase 3 (LH propagation).** The attribute grammar (§1.6.1) is a single top-down pass over the AST. Each rule (R1–R6) maps a well-typed Phase 2 node to a well-typed Phase 3 node. The only structural transformation is R5 (leaf qualification): `node ↦ node LH d`, which is always type-correct because `LimitedHold.inner : ScheduleExpr` accepts any schedule expression.

#### 2.12.3 Progress and Preservation

**Progress.** A well-typed Phase 1 AST is either:
- A value (Phase 3 resolved AST with no further expansion/propagation needed), or
- Reducible by exactly one of: binding expansion, Repeat desugaring, or LH propagation.

This holds because:
- `IdentifierRef` nodes trigger binding expansion (Phase 1 → 2).
- `RepeatModifier` nodes trigger desugaring (Phase 1 → 2).
- Program-level `LH` param_decl triggers LH propagation (Phase 2 → 3).
- If none of these apply, the AST is already in Phase 3 (a value).

**Preservation.** Each phase transition preserves well-typedness:
- Binding expansion substitutes `IdentifierRef(x)` with the bound value, which is a `ScheduleExpr` → the result is a valid `ScheduleExpr`.
- Repeat desugaring replaces `Repeat(n, S)` with `Compound(Tand, [S, …, S])` → valid `Compound` node.
- LH wrapping replaces `node` with `LimitedHold(d, node)` → valid `LimitedHold` node.

**Corollary.** No well-formed contingency-dsl program produces a type error during semantic analysis. All errors are either lexical (malformed tokens), syntactic (grammar violations), or semantic (constraint violations such as `UNDEFINED_IDENTIFIER` or `ATOMIC_NONPOSITIVE_VALUE`), and are reported before Phase 3 completes.

**Scope limitation.** This analysis covers the DSL's static semantics (compilation pipeline). Runtime type safety — ensuring that the resolved AST, when interpreted by a schedule engine, does not produce undefined behavior — depends on the engine implementation and is outside the scope of this specification.

### 2.13 Denotational Semantics

This section defines a compositional semantic function `⟦_⟧` that maps every `ScheduleExpr` to a mathematical object — a *schedule machine* — and proves that this denotation is adequate with respect to the operational equivalence defined in §2.2.1. Where §2.2.1 defines `≡` via universal quantification over observation traces, denotational semantics enables *compositional* reasoning: the meaning of a compound expression is determined entirely by the meanings of its parts.

#### 2.13.1 Schedule Machines

**Definition 9 (Event).** An *event* is either a response event or a time-tick event carrying the current session clock value:

```
E  ::=  Response(t)        -- operant response at session time t
      | Tick(t)            -- clock advance to session time t
```

**Definition 10 (Outcome).** An *outcome* is the schedule's decision at a given event:

```
O  ::=  Reinforced         -- primary reinforcement delivered
      | Brief              -- brief stimulus / conditioned reinforcer (SecondOrder only)
      | None               -- no consequence
```

**Definition 11 (Schedule machine).** A *schedule machine* is a triple `M = (Σ, σ₀, δ)` where:

- `Σ` is a (possibly infinite) set of internal states,
- `σ₀ ∈ Σ` is the initial state,
- `δ : Σ × E → Σ × O` is the transition function.

Given an event sequence `τ = ⟨e₁, e₂, …, eₙ⟩`, the *run* of `M` on `τ` is defined inductively:

```
run(M, ⟨⟩)        = ⟨⟩
run(M, ⟨e₁⟩ ++ τ) = let (σ', o) = δ(σ₀, e₁)
                      in ⟨o⟩ ++ run((Σ, σ', δ), τ)
```

The *outcome sequence* is `outcomes(M, τ) = run(M, τ)`.

**Definition 12 (Extensional equivalence).** Two schedule machines `M₁ = (Σ₁, σ₁, δ₁)` and `M₂ = (Σ₂, σ₂, δ₂)` are *extensionally equivalent*, written `M₁ ≈ M₂`, if they produce identical outcome sequences for every finite event sequence:

```
M₁ ≈ M₂  ⟺  ∀τ ∈ E*. outcomes(M₁, τ) = outcomes(M₂, τ)
```

Note: `≈` is the machine-level analogue of the expression-level `≡` (Definition 4, §2.2.1). The Adequacy Theorem (§2.13.6) establishes their coincidence.

#### 2.13.2 The Semantic Function

The semantic function `⟦_⟧ : ScheduleExpr → ScheduleMachine` is defined inductively on the AST structure. All denotations below operate on the Phase 3 (Resolved) AST (§2.12.1) — after binding expansion, Repeat desugaring, and LH propagation.

#### 2.13.3 Atomic Schedule Denotations

**Ratio schedules.** For `dist ∈ {Fixed, Variable, Random}` and `n ∈ ℤ⁺`:

```
⟦Atomic(dist, Ratio, n)⟧ = (Σ, σ₀, δ)  where
    Σ   = ℤ≥0 × ValueSeq           -- (response_count, value_generator)
    σ₀  = (0, init(dist, n))
    δ((k, g), Response(t)) =
        let target = current(g) in
        if k + 1 ≥ target
            then ((0, advance(g)), Reinforced)
            else ((k + 1, g), None)
    δ((k, g), Tick(t)) = ((k, g), None)
```

Where `ValueSeq` is the value generator: `current(g)` returns the target for this cycle, and `advance(g)` moves to the next cycle value. For Fixed, `current = n` always. For Variable, values follow the Fleshler-Hoffman (1962) sequence. For Random, values are sampled from a geometric distribution with mean `n`.

**Interval schedules.** For `dist ∈ {Fixed, Variable, Random}` and `t ∈ ℝ⁺`:

```
⟦Atomic(dist, Interval, t)⟧ = (Σ, σ₀, δ)  where
    Σ   = ℝ≥0 × Bool × ValueSeq   -- (elapsed, interval_elapsed, value_generator)
    σ₀  = (0, false, init(dist, t))
    δ((e, _, g), Tick(t')) =
        let target = current(g) in
        ((t' − t_last_reinforcement, t' − t_last_reinforcement ≥ target, g), None)
    δ((e, true, g), Response(t')) =
        ((0, false, advance(g)), Reinforced)
    δ((e, false, g), Response(t')) =
        ((e, false, g), None)
```

**Time schedules.** For `dist ∈ {Fixed, Variable, Random}` and `t ∈ ℝ⁺`:

```
⟦Atomic(dist, Time, t)⟧ = (Σ, σ₀, δ)  where
    Σ   = ℝ≥0 × ValueSeq           -- (elapsed, value_generator)
    σ₀  = (0, init(dist, t))
    δ((e, g), Tick(t')) =
        let target = current(g) in
        if t' − t_last_reinforcement ≥ target
            then ((0, advance(g)), Reinforced)
            else ((t' − t_last_reinforcement, g), None)
    δ((e, g), Response(t')) = ((e, g), None)
```

Note: Time schedules are response-independent — response events do not affect state transitions or outcomes.

**Special schedules.**

```
⟦EXT⟧ = ({∗}, ∗, λ(∗, e). (∗, None))

⟦CRF⟧ = ⟦Atomic(Fixed, Ratio, 1)⟧
```

EXT has a trivial one-state machine that never reinforces. CRF is definitionally equal to FR(1) (§1.3).

#### 2.13.4 Combinator Denotations

Let `⟦Sᵢ⟧ = (Σᵢ, σᵢ, δᵢ)` for each component `i`.

**Product combinators** (parallel topology). These combine state spaces as Cartesian products.

```
⟦Conc(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧ = (Σ₁ × … × Σₙ, (σ₁, …, σₙ), δ)  where
    δ((s₁, …, sₙ), e) =
        let (s'ᵢ, oᵢ) = δᵢ(sᵢ, e)  for each i
        in ((s'₁, …, s'ₙ), aggregate_conc(o₁, …, oₙ))
    aggregate_conc: each component independently reinforces its own operandum
```

```
⟦Alt(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧ = (Σ₁ × … × Σₙ, (σ₁, …, σₙ), δ)  where
    δ((s₁, …, sₙ), e) =
        let (s'ᵢ, oᵢ) = δᵢ(sᵢ, e)  for each i
        in if ∃i. oᵢ = Reinforced
            then ((σ₁, …, σₙ), Reinforced)    -- all components reset
            else ((s'₁, …, s'ₙ), None)
```

```
⟦Conj(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧ = (Σ₁ × … × Σₙ × 𝒫({1..n}), (σ₁, …, σₙ, ∅), δ)  where
    δ((s₁, …, sₙ, sat), e) =
        let (s'ᵢ, oᵢ) = δᵢ(sᵢ, e)  for each i
        let sat' = sat ∪ {i | oᵢ = Reinforced}
        in if sat' = {1..n}
            then ((σ₁, …, σₙ, ∅), Reinforced)   -- all satisfied → reinforce + reset
            else ((s'₁, …, s'ₙ, sat'), None)
```

**Sequential combinators** (coproduct/chain topology).

```
⟦Chain(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧ = (Σ₁ + … + Σₙ, inj₁(σ₁), δ)  where
    δ(injₖ(sₖ), e) =
        let (s'ₖ, oₖ) = δₖ(sₖ, e) in
        if oₖ = Reinforced ∧ k < n
            then (injₖ₊₁(σₖ₊₁), None)          -- advance to next link (no reinforcement)
        else if oₖ = Reinforced ∧ k = n
            then (inj₁(σ₁), Reinforced)          -- final link → reinforce + restart
        else (injₖ(s'ₖ), None)
```

`⟦Tand(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧` has identical transition structure to `Chain`. The distinction is discriminability (presence/absence of S^D), which is an environmental variable outside the schedule machine's transition function. At the denotational level:

```
⟦Tand(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧ ≈ ⟦Chain(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧
```

This captures the formal fact that Tand and Chain are procedurally identical from the schedule engine's perspective; their behavioral difference arises from S^D control, not from the reinforcement contingency itself. (Ferster & Skinner, 1957, Ch. 11–12.)

**Alternating combinators** (switched topology).

```
⟦Mult(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧ = (Σ₁ × … × Σₙ × ℕ, (σ₁, …, σₙ, 1), δ)  where
    δ((s₁, …, sₙ, k), e) =
        let (s'ₖ, oₖ) = δₖ(sₖ, e)                    -- only active component processes event
        let s'ⱼ = sⱼ for j ≠ k                         -- inactive components frozen
        in if oₖ = Reinforced
            then ((s'₁, …, s'ₙ, switch(k, n)), Reinforced)   -- environment selects next
            else ((s'₁, …, s'ₙ, k), None)
    switch: component transition function (environment-controlled, not schedule-determined)
```

`⟦Mix(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧` has identical structure — the Mult/Mix distinction is discriminability, parallel to Chain/Tand:

```
⟦Mix(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧ ≈ ⟦Mult(S₁, …, Sₙ)⟧
```

#### 2.13.5 Modifier and Wrapper Denotations

**LimitedHold.** Let `⟦S⟧ = (Σ_S, σ_S, δ_S)`.

```
⟦S LH d⟧ = (Σ_S × LHPhase, (σ_S, Waiting), δ)  where
    LHPhase  ::=  Waiting | HoldOpen(t_sat)

    δ((s, Waiting), e) =
        let (s', o) = δ_S(s, e) in
        if o = Reinforced
            then ((s', HoldOpen(time(e))), None)     -- S satisfied → open hold window
            else ((s', Waiting), None)

    δ((s, HoldOpen(t₀)), Response(t)) =
        if t − t₀ ≤ d
            then ((reset(s), Waiting), Reinforced)    -- response within window → deliver
            else ((reset(s), Waiting), None)           -- window expired

    δ((s, HoldOpen(t₀)), Tick(t)) =
        if t − t₀ > d
            then ((reset(s), Waiting), None)           -- window expired, cancel
            else ((s, HoldOpen(t₀)), None)
```

This directly formalizes the state machine in §1.6 as a compositional denotation. The inner schedule's denotation `⟦S⟧` is embedded unchanged; LH adds a phase wrapper.

**Differential reinforcement modifiers.** Let `⟦S⟧ = (Σ_S, σ_S, δ_S)`.

```
⟦DRL(t, S)⟧ = (Σ_S × ℝ≥0, (σ_S, ∞), δ)  where
    δ((s, t_last), Response(t')) =
        let IRT = t' − t_last in
        let (s', o) = δ_S(s, Response(t')) in
        if IRT ≥ t ∧ o = Reinforced
            then ((s', t'), Reinforced)
            else ((reset(s), t'), None)                -- IRT too short → reset
    δ((s, t_last), Tick(t')) = let (s', _) = δ_S(s, Tick(t')) in ((s', t_last), None)
```

`DRH(t, S)` replaces the IRT condition with `IRT ≤ t`. `DRO(t)` reinforces the absence of a target response for duration `t` — its denotation is a timer-based machine independent of an inner schedule.

**SecondOrder.** Let `⟦Unit⟧ = (Σ_U, σ_U, δ_U)` and `⟦Overall⟧ = (Σ_O, σ_O, δ_O)`.

```
⟦SecondOrder(Overall, Unit)⟧ = (Σ_U × Σ_O × ℕ, (σ_U, σ_O, 0), δ)  where
    δ((u, o, c), e) =
        let (u', o_u) = δ_U(u, e) in
        if o_u = Reinforced                                -- unit completed
            then let c' = c + 1 in
                 let (o', o_o) = δ_O(o, UnitCompletion) in
                 if o_o = Reinforced
                     then ((σ_U, σ_O, 0), Reinforced)     -- primary reinforcement
                     else ((σ_U, o', c'), Brief)           -- brief stimulus
            else ((u', o, c), None)
```

This corresponds exactly to the state machine in §2.11.1, now expressed as a composition of the denotations of the unit and overall schedules.

#### 2.13.6 Adequacy Theorem

**Theorem 9 (Adequacy).** The denotational semantics is adequate with respect to the operational semantics: for all schedule expressions `S₁`, `S₂`:

```
S₁ ≡ S₂  ⟺  ⟦S₁⟧ ≈ ⟦S₂⟧
```

*Proof sketch.* Both relations are defined by universal quantification over event sequences. The operational `≡` (Definition 4) quantifies over observation traces `τ ∈ T` and compares `outcome(S, τ)`. The denotational `≈` (Definition 12) quantifies over event sequences `τ ∈ E*` and compares `outcomes(⟦S⟧, τ)`.

(*Right-to-left*.) Suppose `⟦S₁⟧ ≈ ⟦S₂⟧`. An observation trace (Definition 2) is a finite sequence of timestamped events, which is exactly an element of `E*`. The `outcome` function of Definition 3 extracts the reinforcement decisions from a run, which is the projection of `outcomes(⟦S⟧, τ)` onto the `{Reinforced, None}` components. Therefore `outcomes(⟦S₁⟧, τ) = outcomes(⟦S₂⟧, τ)` implies `outcome(S₁, τ) = outcome(S₂, τ)` for all `τ`.

(*Left-to-right*.) Suppose `S₁ ≡ S₂`. We must show that the denotational machines produce identical outcomes. By construction, `⟦S⟧` faithfully implements the operational behavior of `S`: each semantic clause (§2.13.3–§2.13.5) mirrors the corresponding operational specification (state machines in §1.6, §2.11.1, and the combinator definitions in §2.1). The canonical initial state `σ₀` of Definition 3 corresponds to the `σ₀` of each machine. Thus `outcome(S, τ) = outcomes(⟦S⟧, τ)|_{Reinforced/None}` for all `τ`, and `S₁ ≡ S₂` implies `⟦S₁⟧ ≈ ⟦S₂⟧`. ∎

**Corollary (Compositionality).** If `S₁ ≡ S₂`, then for any context `C[_]` (a schedule expression with a hole), `C[S₁] ≡ C[S₂]`. This follows from the compositional structure of `⟦_⟧`: each combinator clause builds the compound machine from the component machines, so replacing a component with an extensionally equivalent machine yields an extensionally equivalent compound.

#### 2.13.7 Example: Denotational Proofs

The denotational framework simplifies several proofs by reducing them to algebraic calculations on machines.

**Theorem 3 (re-derived): `Alt(S, EXT) ≡ S`.**

```
⟦Alt(S, EXT)⟧ = (Σ_S × {∗}, (σ_S, ∗), δ)  where
    δ((s, ∗), e) =
        let (s', o) = δ_S(s, e) in
        let (∗, None) = δ_EXT(∗, e) in      -- EXT never reinforces
        if o = Reinforced
            then ((σ_S, ∗), Reinforced)
            else ((s', ∗), None)
```

The `{∗}` component is inert — it contributes no information and never triggers reinforcement. The machine's behavior is entirely determined by `⟦S⟧`. Formally, projecting away the `{∗}` component yields a machine isomorphic to `⟦S⟧`. Therefore `⟦Alt(S, EXT)⟧ ≈ ⟦S⟧`, and by adequacy, `Alt(S, EXT) ≡ S`. ∎

**Theorem 4 (re-derived): `Conj(S, EXT) ≡ EXT`.**

```
⟦Conj(S, EXT)⟧ = (Σ_S × {∗} × 𝒫({1,2}), (σ_S, ∗, ∅), δ)
```

For the conjunction to reinforce, both components must be satisfied. Since `δ_EXT` never produces `Reinforced`, `2 ∉ sat'` for all traces. Therefore `sat' ≠ {1, 2}` always, and the machine never reinforces. This is extensionally equivalent to `⟦EXT⟧`. ∎

**Theorem 7 (re-derived): `Repeat(m, Repeat(n, S)) ≡ Repeat(m × n, S)`.**

After desugaring, `Repeat(m, Repeat(n, S))` becomes `Tand(Tand(S,…,S), …, Tand(S,…,S))` (m copies of n-ary Tand). The Chain/Tand denotation uses a coproduct of state spaces with sequential advancement. By associativity of coproduct sequencing:

```
⟦Tand(Tand(S₁,…,Sₙ), Tand(Sₙ₊₁,…,S₂ₙ))⟧
    ≈ ⟦Tand(S₁,…,Sₙ, Sₙ₊₁,…,S₂ₙ)⟧
```

This generalizes to `m × n` copies, yielding `⟦Repeat(m × n, S)⟧`. ∎

## Part III: Experiment Layer — Multi-Phase Composition

### 3.1 Motivation

Parts I and II formalize the within-session contingency structure: atomic schedules, combinators, modifiers, and their algebraic and denotational properties. However, JEAB experimental procedures consist of ordered *phases* (conditions) with phase-change criteria — the across-session structure that Method sections describe as "Baseline → Treatment → Reversal" or "Conditions were presented in the following order..."

No existing formal notation system unifies these two levels. Mechner (1959) and State Notation (Snapper, Kadden, & Inglis, 1982) formalize within-session trial structure. Cooper, Heron, & Heward (2020) use A-B-A-B notation for design structure. The Experiment Layer bridges this gap.

### 3.2 Phase Sequence as a Non-Commutative Monoid

**Definition 13 (Phase).** A Phase is a triple:

```
Phase = (label : String, meta : PhaseMeta, schedule : ScheduleExpr)
```

where `PhaseMeta` includes session specification and stability criteria.

**Definition 14 (Phase Sequence).** A Phase Sequence is an ordered, non-empty list of Phases:

```
PhaseSequence = Phase⁺
```

**Algebraic properties of Phase Sequences:**

*Property 1 (Associativity).* Concatenation of phase sequences is associative:

```
(P₁ ++ P₂) ++ P₃ = P₁ ++ (P₂ ++ P₃)
```

*Property 2 (Non-commutativity).* Phase order matters — behavioral history is irreversible:

```
[Baseline, Treatment] ≠ [Treatment, Baseline]
```

This is a fundamental constraint from the experimental analysis of behavior: the organism that has experienced Treatment before Baseline is in a different behavioral state than one that experienced Baseline first (Sidman, 1960, Ch. 4).

*Property 3 (Identity element).* The empty sequence `[]` is the identity for concatenation. In practice, an experiment must have at least one phase (minItems=1 in the schema), so the identity is not operationally useful.

**Conclusion:** Phase sequences form a *free monoid* over the set of phases, with concatenation as the operation. This is the simplest algebraic structure that respects the temporal irreversibility of behavioral experiments.

### 3.3 Shaping as Syntactic Sugar

**Definition 15 (Shaping Expansion).** A `shaping` declaration with steps variable `x = [v₁, ..., vₙ]`, phase metadata `M`, and schedule template `T(x)` expands to:

```
⟦shaping(Name, x=[v₁,...,vₙ], M, T(x))⟧ = [Phase(Name_1, M, T(v₁)), ..., Phase(Name_n, M, T(vₙ))]
```

This is analogous to `Repeat(n, S)` → `Tand(S, ..., S)` (§2.2.3), operating at the experiment level rather than the schedule level.

**Multi-variable expansion:** Given steps `x = [x₁,...,xₙ]` and `y = [y₁,...,yₙ]` (same length), the expansion zips pairwise:

```
⟦shaping(Name, x=[x₁,...,xₙ], y=[y₁,...,yₙ], M, T(x,y))⟧
  = [Phase(Name_1, M, T(x₁,y₁)), ..., Phase(Name_n, M, T(xₙ,yₙ))]
```

**Constraint:** All steps lists must have identical length (`|x| = |y|`). This is enforced statically.

**Non-Turing-completeness:** `steps` lists are finite literals — no loops, recursion, or arithmetic. The expansion is a pure macro substitution bounded by the list length.

**Definition 16 (Shaping Expansion with Interleave).** Let a `shaping` declaration carry steps `x⃗ = (x₁=[v₁₁,…,v₁ₙ], …, xₘ=[vₘ₁,…,vₘₙ])`, phase metadata `M`, schedule template `T(x⃗)`, and an ordered list of *interleave references* `R⃗ = [r₁, …, rₖ]` (k ≥ 0). Let the boolean `trailing = ¬last(R⃗).no_trailing` (default `true`; vacuously `false` if k=0).

**Step 1 — Generate the base list (E-SHAPING-MULTI).**

```
G = [Phase(Name_1, M, T(v⃗₁)), …, Phase(Name_n, M, T(v⃗ₙ))]
```

where `v⃗ᵢ = (v₁ᵢ, …, vₘᵢ)` is the i-th column of the zipped step variables.

**Step 2 — Build the gap block from references, indexed by insertion site i.**

```
B(i) = [ clone(R(r₁), Name, i), clone(R(r₂), Name, i), …, clone(R(rₖ), Name, i) ]
```

where `R(rⱼ)` resolves the previously-declared template phase with label `rⱼ`, and `clone(P, Name, i)` returns a deep copy of `P` whose `label` is rewritten to `P.label ++ "_after_" ++ Name ++ "_" ++ str(i)`. All other fields (`schedule`, `criterion`, `phase_annotations`, `phase_param_decls`) are copied verbatim.

**Step 3 — Intercalate (default) or intersperse (with `no_trailing`).**

```
intercalate(B, [a₁,…,aₙ])  =  [a₁] ++ B(1) ++ [a₂] ++ B(2) ++ … ++ B(n−1) ++ [aₙ] ++ B(n)
intersperse(B, [a₁,…,aₙ])  =  [a₁] ++ B(1) ++ [a₂] ++ B(2) ++ … ++ B(n−1) ++ [aₙ]
```

The full expansion is then:

```
⟦shaping(Name, x⃗, M, T(x⃗), interleave=R⃗)⟧
   = intercalate(B, G)   if trailing
   = intersperse(B, G)   otherwise
```

**Properties.**

1. **Length boundedness.** `|expansion| = n + n·k` (intercalate) or `n + (n−1)·k` (intersperse). Strictly bounded by the syntactic constants `n` and `k`; non-Turing-completeness preserved.
2. **Termination.** `clone`, `++`, `intercalate`, `intersperse` are total on finite inputs.
3. **Identity in absence of interleave.** `R⃗ = []` reduces to E-SHAPING-MULTI: `intercalate([], G) = G`.
4. **Annotation locality.** Cloned phases inherit only the source template's annotations and parameters. The enclosing shaping's annotations and `{ident}` placeholders affect only `T(v⃗ᵢ)` in `G`; they do not propagate into clones. This guarantees that the template `Recovery` runs identically (e.g., at a fixed reference dose) at every insertion site, regardless of which shaping it neighbors.
5. **Template consumption.** Each phase referenced in `R⃗` is removed from the standalone PhaseSequence at its declaration position; the phase exists only as the template for clones. (See grammar.ebnf constraint 76.)

**Constraints invoked.**

- Constraint 64 (no forward `use` references) extends to `interleave` via constraint 74 (same lookup mechanism, same error code `UNDEFINED_PHASE_REF`).
- Constraint 63 (phase name uniqueness) extends to clone labels via constraint 63b.
- Constraint 75 forbids self-interleave (referencing the enclosing shaping's own future generated phases).
- Constraint 76 specifies the template-consumption semantics that excludes the source phase from the standalone PhaseSequence.

**Reference.** John, W. S., & Nader, M. A. (2016). *Behavioral economic analysis of the reinforcing strength of cocaine* style dose-response paradigms — "each dose was followed by a return to baseline" — map directly onto `intercalate(Recovery, [Dose₁, …, Dose₆])`, yielding the canonical 6 dose × 6 recovery (12 phase) sequence with no manual phase enumeration.

### 3.4 Denotational Semantics of Experiments

**Definition 17 (Experiment Machine).** An Experiment Machine maps a Phase Sequence to a sequence of Schedule Machines:

```
⟦experiment⟧ : PhaseSequence → ScheduleMachine*
⟦[P₁, P₂, ..., Pₙ]⟧ = (⟦P₁.schedule⟧, ⟦P₂.schedule⟧, ..., ⟦Pₙ.schedule⟧)
```

Each `⟦Pᵢ.schedule⟧` is the Mealy-machine schedule machine defined in §2.13. Phase transitions are governed by `PhaseMeta` (session count, stability criteria) which operate on the behavioral data stream — these are runtime concerns, not syntactic properties.

**Compositionality:** The experiment-level semantics is trivially compositional because each phase's schedule semantics is independent. The experiment machine is a product of phase machines:

```
⟦experiment⟧ = ∏ᵢ ⟦phaseᵢ.schedule⟧
```

**Adequacy:** The experiment-level denotation is adequate with respect to the phase-level operational semantics: two experiments are equivalent if and only if their phase sequences contain pairwise-equivalent schedules.

### 3.5 Annotation Inheritance

Experiment-level annotations propagate to all phases, analogous to program-level LH propagation (§1.6.1):

```
R0  Experiment → shared_annotations, phases[1..n]
    ∀i: phases[i].effective_annotations = merge(shared_annotations, phases[i].phase_annotations)
```

where `merge(shared, local)` = `local` for keys present in both, `shared` for keys present only in shared. This matches the program-level vs. schedule-level annotation resolution (grammar.ebnf constraint 15).

## Non-goals / Out of Scope

The DSL covers declarative static semantics of within-session contingencies (Parts I–II) and declarative composition of phase sequences (Part III). The following domains are outside the DSL's design scope; the experiment-core runtime or higher-layer lab management systems bear their responsibility. This section makes explicit the boundary between *cannot be expressed* and *intentionally not expressed*, to prevent user misexpectations.

### N-1. Token economy

Token economies involve state accumulation (addition, subtraction, and exchange of token counts) as a dynamic procedure. The DSL declares the static contingency structure of a single session, so cross-session state management is structurally out of scope — it is the responsibility of experiment-core or a dedicated runtime. The DSL expression of Response Cost is blocking-dependent on this scope decision.

### N-2. Mult / Mix component transition timing

`Mult(FR5, EXT)` and `Mix(VI30, EXT)` declare the component schedule structure, but inter-component switching timing (random, fixed-duration, performance-contingent) is dynamic control that belongs to the contingency-core runtime. The DSL only declares each component's contingency structure.

### N-3. Inter-session schedule progression

Inter-session schedule progressions such as CRF→FR2→FR5→VI30 (e.g., FCT thinning protocols) are matters of protocol design. Each session's schedule can be declared individually in the DSL, but automating the progression rule exceeds the DSL's declarative static semantics.

Part III's experiment layer declaratively covers "ordered phase sequences with phase-change criteria"; session-level thinning progression is handled by the experiment-core adaptive control logic.

### N-4. Real-time adaptive schedules

Automatic update of parameters mid-session based on subject behavior (external override of Adjusting schedule parameter values, external sensor-driven titration, etc.) is outside the DSL layer. Core-Stateful `Adj` supports declarative parameter updates, but external feedback-loop control is the runtime's responsibility.

### N-5. Cross-subject reinforcement references (yoked control)

In yoked designs (Church, 1964), reinforcement of subject A triggers reinforcement for subject B. The Core's single-program scope cannot express cross-subject references; this is reserved as a `yoked-extension` candidate in the future Schedule Extension space.

### N-6. Research ethics and clinical metadata

Informed consent, IRB approval, and subject-protection safety constraints are the responsibility of experiment management systems (runtime / lab management software), not the DSL. ABA social validity assessments, FBA function classifications (attention, escape, automatic, etc.), and BACB clinical labels (DRA/DRI/NCR, etc.) are similarly outside the DSL's annotation purposes and are reserved as 3rd-party extension points such as `clinical-metadata`.
